I made a mistake buying this one and I don't think anyone should buy this phone. I swapped it for the Samsung S23, so I'll compare it with that in this review. It's $250 more, which I did NOT want to pay. I'm not a spender, but I guarantee you, save up some more and treat yourself better. You use your phone every day, trust me you want a better one than the 7a.(1) Battery life and charging. awful. This is the main reason you don't want this phone. This phone has 18W wired charging (roughly 2 hours to charge) and 7.5W wireless charging (roughly 4 hours to charge). The battery lasts about 4-5 hours. If you are like most people and use your phone for 2-4 hours a day, this phone WILL die before nighttime. Do you always want to carry a charger? Do you want the anxiety of worrying when you don't have a charger? Even if you think you'll be fine, what might start as a decent battery will be unusable after 18-24 months of use. That'll be an $100 new battery or entirely new phone.Pixel 7a: 18W wired charging and 7.5 wireless. Battery endurance test: 76hrSamsung S23: 25W wired charging and 15W wireless. Battery endurance test: 101hrComically, the Samsung S23 has a 12.5% SMALLER battery, yet lasts 32% longer.(2) Speed of the device. Google makes its own processors, with the Tensor 2 chip in this one. I expected very good performance given that it's the same processor they use in their Google Pixel  7 Pro phone. The processor is FINE for most things, but gaming is subpar. As a normal user you could get by with this, but just know it's SLOW and KILLS THE BATTERY. I used Geekbench, an app that determines phone performance, to compare this with the S23.Pixel 7a (Google Tensor 2 chip): 3191S23 (Snapdragon Gen 2 chip): 4950 (155% difference)Here's the GFXBench score, a frames-per-second stress test that shows game performance:Pixel 7a: 62fpsS23: 110fps (177% difference)(3) Cameras: excellent, of course. Pixels have some of the best cameras in the industry. You might think this phone is worth it for the cameras and it is, so long as you have a charger with you everywhere.Pixel 7a: Ultrawide and regular camera. Takes pictures that look less premium, but are more true to life and have the best detail. The camera also comes with some crazy AI editing features that Google loves to advertise.S23: Ultrawide, regular, and telephoto (3x zoom) camera. Takes pictures you might expect from a professional camera. Very contrasty, lots of colors, better camera performance. As an amateur photographer, I prefer the S23 because I like color and contrasty.(4) Software. Both these phones will have 3-5 years of upgrades, thanks to new Google and Samsung policies. Google Pixels have the best of the best Android features, simply because Google owns Android. Samsung uses a modified version of Android called One UI (5.1). This one is up for personal preference. One UI has WAY more features, controls, settings, etc, but it can be a little intimidating. Most people either love or hate Samsung's One UI.In summary--------------I spent the $250 more for the Samsung S23. The 7a was one of the worst phones I've ever owned and the S23 is hands-down the best phone I've ever owned. The price really hurts your wallet, but if you use your phone every day, the little things add up. You might think you can live with the awful battery of the 7a, but after a year or two I guarantee you, you'll want it replaced. Would you rather buy a new phone/battery in two years or buy a better phone today that might last you 3-5 years? You'll save money AND have a better phone.Please, please do not buy the 7a. The S23 might not be the right price for everyone, but look at these alternatives before you make the mistake of buying the 7a:- Samsung S23, a flagship, best of the best, but much more expensive.- Google Pixel 6a, last year's model. Better battery, slightly worse cameras, much cheaper.- Google Pixel 7, almost a year old and can probably get it for a similar price. Larger, better cameras, better battery.- Samsung A54, the mid-range Samsung. Comparable performance to the Pixel 7a with better battery but worse cameras and trade-offs in other areas.","Horrific battery life, be cautious before you buy",2023-06-30,2.0

However that phone was durable and well made. This phone is cheaply made. Feels like cheap plastic, easily slips out of hand if you don't have a phone case on it. It's a thicker phone so when it vibrates you hear the echo thru the phone. Seems to lag a lot especially when you've been using it for a while. Overheats easily. Also the screen seems to have a mind of it's own. If your just reading something suddenly your phone will be going to the webpage from an ad without you touching anything. The pros are good battery life so far. And it's a 5g phone. I guess the price to because I don't need a $1000+ dollar phone I just need the basics. But compared to my last phone the quality is definitely lacking. Lastly this phone isn't huge but it's a lot bigger than my last phone so holding it with one hand can definitely be uncomfortable after a while so a phone case and ring to hold the phone are a must.",It's okay.,2023-08-17,3.0

Unlike many people I can't justify spending more than $200 on a phone that is likely to be dropped/broken/malfunctioning within a couple years. Unfortunately that means digging through bargain bin phones. As far as this one goes, its pretty good overall. My most recent budget phone before this was a Samsung Galaxy A03sPros:- Much, MUCH faster than the A03s in every possible way- Battery life almost as good as the A03s while still being way faster- Stylus works pretty well and is nice for precision use cases- Screen is real sharp and generally bright enough. 90hz is useless to me so I turn it to 60hz to save batteryOkay:- The camera is 12MP, not ""52"" or whatever they stamp on there. This reminds me of the old days of computer monitors where the size as marketed was edge to edge of the case instead of the screen itself. It has aggressive filtering applied to every photo no matter what settings you change. I am not trying to be a pro photographer with my phone so this doesnt bother me much but I wish they'd just put a non-filtered 12MP camera instead of all this silly marketing ""AI"" mess.Cons:- The moto firmware is mediocre. The ""peek"" function would be better if it just showed the normal lockscreen but no, they had to go and make a less accessible, more annoying version. This makes their 'tap to wake' function, that I normally love on phones, far less useful.","Overall good phone, fast hardware. Mediocre moto software",2023-08-31,4.0,R2LFWQSME0K77O,Heimish Reviews,0.0,"There are a couple design flaws.  First, the speaker is at the bottom of the phone. I tended to rest it on my chest while talking on speaker phone and the speaker was muffled by my shirt.  It also had pointy edges along the part where the speaker opening is at the bottom. It was uncomfortable and bulky to hold while trying to talk or watch videos. The part that was most annoying is that it kept disconnecting from the wifi and without knowing that it had, I ended up using up all of my 5g of data for the month in one day.  Every time I would reconnect to wifi, it would drop again. After a week I just had enough and returned the phone.  With the case I bought it was also too heavy for the magnetic phone holder and would just slide off.  The fingerprint reader was also not easy to access, especially with the case on.

Battery is great, not two days, but a whole day. Everything about it very good. Of course, I don't know about longevity, but if this phone continues for a year or so as it is now it will above 5 stars to me. I've had this about 2 weeks. I tried 2 other phones and returned them without any hassle. Thank you Amazon. But this phone was under $200 and I'm very happy with it. The 6 gb ram is very efficient and the 256 gb storage is more than enough plus I get to keep photos and docs on an SD card. I don't play games beyond solitaire and gin rummy so a super phone with high end specs for sophisticated games is obviously not a priority. I read a lot so I'll have a book, dictionary, Wikipedia, email, and text open at same time and there is no lag when switching between apps. Photos are fine for me. Not and expert photographer so was not looking for phone to double as top of line camera. But photos are excellent for my standards. Screen is bright and clear. It has good receiver for phone calls, I'm on Tello. Calls are clear and not one drop so far. I have another phone other than Motorola that drops calls. I contribute the drops to the receiver unit in the phone. I have two Motorola cells and both have good receiver capabilities. Wifi is both 5g and 2.4g and again, great speedy connection. I use ATT wifi. I also use the phone to keep track of my steps. That's important to me. It is very accurate if that's a priority to you. Also it connects to my Samsung Galaxy Watch with no problems. The 6.5 inch screen is a perfect size for me. My only wish is that it were a bit lighter, but not as heavy as the Moto G stylus I also have.

Inside no packing material and phone box not taped shut and inside everything very used and phone not in sleeve but in the blue inner box paperwork comes it. It had been ripped up completely and taped together in pieces. Miraculously the phone is not scratched up. I regret buying used again. I must be an idiot, but the internal speaker at least works. From a very nice exp with a defective phone to a very used and overpriced used phone. It's a 100.00 at best the way I received it. For another 30.00 a brand new phone. Again, I must be idiot buying a used phone. Never again.In the end the phone seems to be OK and I'll watch to see if any problems come up.

It's metal body gives me a very premium feeling that I normally could only expect on $1000 phones like the iphone pro max or samsung s series. What I like the most is that we get all the accessories that we can't normally see on the high end phones, like dual sim support and the micro sd card support. Honestly getting the micro sd card slot on a high quality phone is pretty much the single dominate factor that led to my purchase decision. The phone also comes with other nice features like night vision camera, fm radio, high power flash light, etc, which are all nice pluses, but won't make me so excited about. However in my opinion, the only regret about the phone is that it didn't comes with a 3.5mm audio jack, which are normally found on other doogee phones like s61 or s51. I am not sure what caused the designer of the phone to remove the audio jack, but it's certainly a big loss for a customer who still love to use wired headphones like me.

The phone has issues with the power button, it delays starting up after is sleeps, and has trouble switching quickly between apps, and occasionally doesn't wake up at all and needs a forced restart. Don't get me wrong, it works, it just requires a lot of patience. It's also bigger and heavier that you'd expect (but that's probably rugged phones in general).

B0B3PSRHHN,Google Pixel 6a - 5G Android Phone - Unlocked Smartphone with 12 Megapixel Camera and 24-Hour Battery - Charcoal,339.98,4.3,5200,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B3PSRHHN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_top?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,Smartphones,R36GQP2LHY1DIG,4.0,"The best all-around phone at this price point (in the US, at least)",189.0,R3AAKHR07NTT1B,5.0,More than meets my needs,24.0,R4KHL0ERH66X7,4.0,Solid phone so far and I'm very pleased with it,1.0,R3840XP5ER7LXA,4.0,"For the price, there isn't a better option!",0.0,R1EJ4Q5CVD6V2Z,4.0,"Moving on from Moto G line, great alternative",47.0,R36GQP2LHY1DIG,Thomas Hicks,189.0,"TLDR:  The Pixel 6a is a phone that I can safely recommend to anyone who just wants a device that works, takes decent enough pictures, can get through the day on a single charge, and won't break the bank or double one's monthly mobile bill for the next 2 years.  Tech enthusiasts need not apply.However, as a tech enthusiast who bought one of these as a second phone, I could see myself dailying the Pixel 6a without too many regrets.  I mean, I would feel guilty for coming down hard on it in any particular category simply because it's so darn affordable (particularly when it's on sale).  Plus, there's really nothing else in this price range I can recommend to others with any confidence.  What else can you get for around $300 that is this well-rounded?  In the US?  Not much, though you can get some cheapo Motorola phones for less if you're willing to settle for a weak processor, mediocre cameras, an LCD display (rather than OLED), and a cheaper-feeling, all-plastic build.  You'll also have to settle for weaker software support than the Pixel, which guarantees security updates for another 4 years from now (as well as two more Android OS updates after 13).The nearest competitor is probably the Samsung Galaxy A53 (soon to be A54).  It's also on sale regularly, though I've never seen it as low as the 6a has been.  The Sammy does give you a better display (120Hz AMOLED vs 60Hz OLED) and a bigger battery than the Pixel, but it has a weaker Exynos CPU and worse cameras despite the more impressive specs on paper.  I'd take the Pixel 6a hands down, and that's coming from an 11-year Samsung Galaxy fan.Anyway, onto my detailed personal critique of the Pixel 6a...As I said before, I can't really knock it much considering the price point.  HOWEVER, there are a few sore spots that annoy me and will hopefully be improved upon with the upcoming 7a.The first is the display.  While I appreciate the inclusion of an OLED panel at this price, the 60Hz refresh rate makes my eyes bleed while scrolling.  Harsh?  Yeah, but I've been spoiled by 120Hz displays for years now.  Jumping between this and my S22 Ultra regularly makes the difference even more noticeable.  The 7a is supposed to bump it up to 90Hz, which should greatly improve smoothness.  Refresh rate aside, I also find the display to be a bit on the dim side.  Not that it isn't bright enough in most cases (aside from direct sunlight), but even indoors with minimal lighting the display will adjust to about 50% brightness to maintain adequate visibility.  Meanwhile, my Samsung phones (S22 Ultra and old S21+) are only at 25% brightness in the same environment and still somehow appear to be brighter.  And the colors never seem to pop as much on this phone compared to other OLED-equipped phones I've used.  I suppose that's a key difference between OLED and AMOLED.The second issue is the durability of the materials used to make this phone, mainly the plastic on the back panel.  When brand new, the plastic back does an incredible job of imitating the appearance and feel of glass.  But after minimal use (and even inside of a case, as another reviewer pointed out), this material reveals itself to be ridiculously soft and prone to nicks and scratches.  Mine is covered in little pock marks and micro abrasions despite being in a case the majority of its life.  It's so soft that I swear the little nicks in it are probably from dust particles being pressed into it by popping a case on.  Another ding goes to the dated Gorilla Glass 3 covering the display that's also prone to scratches and sounds really thin and hollow when tapped.  I recommend a screen protector.While steady software updates since the phone's release last July have greatly improved the overall user experience, it still suffers from a few hardware-related headaches.  The modem used in this thing (and its siblings) is infamous for being inefficient, having mediocre reception (though I haven't noticed), and creating massive amounts of heat.  Sadly, no amount of updates can remedy that situation.  It's fine as long as you stick to LTE, in my experience.  Enabling 5G pretty much guarantees that your battery will drain much more quickly and that the back of the phone will stay warm at all times.  On the bright side, you can put it in your back pocket and use it as a ""butt warmer"" on cold days.  If you get a second 6a, you can heat both cheeks evenly.  Don't have heated seats in your car?  Problem solved.  Jokes aside, at least the fingerprint reader and random idle battery drain issues that I experienced early on have been fixed.  It's been months since I've gone to bed with 100% battery only to wake up with 65% left for no reason other than ""just Pixel things"" as a friend of mine with a 6 Pro would call little irritating bugs like those.Now that I've done nothing but blast this poor thing in the previous few paragraphs, let me tell you what I think is great about it.For one, I love the size.  While many out there still think it's too large, I think it's perfect.  After handling a behemoth like the S22 Ultra, this one is a pleasure to grasp even while in a case (of which I recommend the Spigen Rugged Armor, but that's another review).  It's just so light and easy to grip compared to what I'm used to.  It's no Zenfone 9 or iPhone 13 Mini, but it feels downright tiny compared to an S22/23 Ultra or Pixel 6/7 Pro.  Folks with small hands or who simply prefer smaller phones will like this one.  This is the compact option in the realm of budget and mid-range phones, as most inexpensive smartphones have 6.5""+ screens for some reason (I guess they're cheaper to make?).The Pixel software perks are probably my second favorite ""feature"" (though I'm not sure if size can be called a feature...well, maybe but nvm).  Being able to see the title and artist of just about any song playing around me at a glance is something I never knew I wanted.  And while I haven't used them personally, the call waiting assistance and Direct My Call (on-screen choices for automated calls) features sound amazing for simplifying a few of life's little annoyances.  I'm sure there's a lot of great things I'm forgetting to mention but those stand out the most for me.Finally, there's the cameras.  Nothing about the hardware here is fancy or premium, or even new.  In fact, the 6a's main image sensor (Sony IMX363) has been used in the Pixel line as far back as the Pixel 3.  What's propping up these tiny, dated image sensors is Google's amazing camera software and image processing.  While the images produced by this combo won't blow you away, you'll be impressed by just how competent and ""honest"" the results are.  The colors and details are very muted and realistic.  If you're fond of the super-colorful, oversharpened, Ultra HDR photos your typical Samsung phone cranks out, you'll be very disappointed by this phone (and Pixels in general) and should look elsewhere.  I actually prefer the main and ultra-wide cameras on this Pixel to my S22 Ultra for the simple fact that it's better at quick, point and shoot photography.  I can whip the 6a out of my pocket, snap a quick photo, and be 100% confident that resulting picture will be serviceable.  I can't say that about any Samsung that I've ever used.  The main con is the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera.  You can zoom up to 7X with the main camera, but your pictures start looking like watercolor paintings at that level of zoom.  I'd go no higher than 3X and even that is pushing it.Other notes to close out this lengthy, rambling review:Speakers are just okay, and the volume slider has to be cranked fairly high to produce enough sound for normal listening.Battery life is fine, but should honestly be better with a 4410 mAh battery onboard.  In a regular day of use for me, I average about 4-5 hours of screen on time with 5G enabled.I can squeeze out an extra hour or two if I disable 5G and stick to LTE, and the phone runs much cooler on average as an added bonus.  I had a OnePlus 8T with a similarly-sized 4500 mAh battery and snapdragon 865 that could get up to 8 hours of SoT (with 5G disabled, as well), so I feel like the Tensor G1 isn't the most efficient SoC around.Charging is slow, coming from someone who used to daily a OnePlus with 65W Warp Charging.  Still, you can fully charge it in less than 2 hours from nearly-dead.  Could be worse, I guess.  Also, there's no wireless charging on the 6a.As far as performance goes, I can't complain about it in daily use scenarios.  It feels very responsive when opening and navigating my usual apps (Gmail, Twitter, twitch, YouTube, Amazon, etc.).  I'm not a phone gamer, so I can't comment on gaming performance though I imagine that it gets rather hot in a short period of time as that's just what the Tensor does.I've already stated repeatedly that I can recommend this phone to just about anyone because it does just about everything well enough for the average person.  However, the 7a is on the horizon and is expected to bring a 90Hz display, wireless charging, the Tensor G2 from the Pixel 7, and better cameras for a similar RRP.  While it won't be as affordable as the discounted 6a when it launches this summer, I imagine we'll be seeing it in the $300 range by Black Friday.  So you may want to wait for that one unless you need a new phone right now.  Still, the 6a at its current price is an absolute bargain, in my honest opinion.","The best all-around phone at this price point (in the US, at least)",2023-03-22,4.0,R2IRNTEPVHZ7G4,TS,69.0,"Update 2: Phone would not connect to mobile network!  Would connect for a few minutes and then drop mobile/data/gps connection, it was such a bummer.  After trying to fix it for a week and even changing mobile carriers, nothing worked- I decided to finally just return the phone and get a new one (same model).  To my surprise, I have had none of the issues with the replacement.  It shipped in a shoebox-size box with no cushioning, which I did not appreciate.  But none of the overheating issues (gets warm but not nearly as bad), none of the issues connecting, etc.So, as an actual functioning phone, and not a cause of intense stress: pretty solid?  Not in love with it relative to the original cost, but it looks pretty (I got the sage), and it works about as well as I would expect.  Fingerprint scanner is not amazing, but seems to be working noticeably better since update.  I have had to redo the finger scan to get it to work.  Also the limit of 4 fingers seems arbitrary, but I have both of my thumbs and pointer fingers which is good enough.Battery life is a bit of a disappointment!  Lasts about a day, and not necessarily a full 24 hours.  Not an issue for me but was hoping for a little extra.  The battery saver mode works pretty well it seems, I don't even notice the difference when it is in use.  Screen is bright enough to view during daylight hours at full brightness, and looks good.  Camera works well, and even low-light photos come out pretty decent.I would prefer a regular audio jack, but have not had any issues other than having to pony up $7 for a USBC/3.5mm adapter.  I do wonder about the life of the port, since the power and audio jack are doing double-duty.Verdict: Pretty good phone!  It ruined my life, briefly.______Update1: Google pushed out an update around 8/4, which means they knew about the issues that people like me were having for a while.Phone still gets very warm, but overheating issue is much better. Does not seem to get quite as hot, and also it does not shut down the way it used to. It used to happen several times per day in any number of situations, but I've only seen it give me the overheating warning once in the last several days, when I was using the camera for about a half an hour. This is still a flaw, and not an issue I've run into with other smartphones.General complaints include the fact that I do not like the fingerprint reader. I'm upgrading from a Motorola Moto G5 S Plus that I've had for about four and a half years. The Pixel 6A fingerprint reader is built into the screen, and maybe that's why it is slower. If you are not used to a more responsive fingerprint reader you may not know the difference.Overall, I am not wowed.  Having dealt  with the overheating issue, it makes me suspicious about the life of the battery, in case any damage was done by the overheating processor.  At this point I am likely to keep the same model, but would want to be shipped a replacement unit just in case.  Not a strong recommendation.Original:I will try update this in a week or so, but it's not looking good so far.I have an overheating issue, which is apparently somewhat common with these phones.  Luckily I bought a case for it, because it's physically uncomfortable to hold without one.When the phone gets too hot, any number of bad things happen - cellular/data quality begins to degrade, or the phone will just shut down on its own.I have gotten some  irritating Google messages warning me about my phone overheating, and then giving me advice on what to do about it. I am not using it to stir nacho cheese, or take pictures of the inside of an active volcano. I'm not even playing games at all or watching videos that much - I'm doing regular cell phone things, and my phone doesn't like it.  The ""tips"" Google wants to give me are particularly irritating, because they already know this overheating is an issue, and they're attempting to pretend like it is a user problem and not a hardware / software issue.Anyway, I'm going to give it a few more days to see if the issue persists, but I'm very disappointed so far.  I may have to send it back in case this particular phone happens to be a dud.",Seems perfectly cromulent. (update),2022-08-04,3.0

This annoyed me when scrolling through apps or webpages and seeing text fade through these ""gray zones"" that I couldn't make go away- and this was from a brand new unit that I only had for a few days. Aside from my screen defect, the Pixel 7 was still a great phone.When it comes to the software experience, the clean Android experience is still one of the best that you can get, in addition to also being the first to get new Android updates as they roll out. The color themes that you can choose based on your wallpaper adds another level to customization, and you can even apply these colors to some app icons as well. The software is smooth, and I haven't had any of the software bugs that some others have had. However, what really makes the Pixel experience great are some of the features you can't get on other Android phones such as Google's ""screen call"", ""hold for me"", photo unblur, and magic erase options. My favorite of these is definitely screen call, as when enabled you can have the Pixel automatically answer the call for you and give you a transcript based on the call to let you know whether you should pick up or not in case it is spam. I get a lot of Spam calls personally, so this has saved me the hassle of having to take a lot of unnecessary calls. When it comes to the photo modes, the magic eraser works great when there isn't too much going on, but the photo unblur ability isn't that great. I found that even photos that are only slightly blurred sometimes just get added sharpness from this mode, but without actually unblurring the parts of the photo I needed. My overall favorite part of the default android experience though, is the Google toolbar on the bottom of your homepage. While on the Pixel this bar is not removable, I found it to be the best implementation out of any android phone as it not only allows you to search Google whenever you need, but it also searches your device for apps, videos, and more that might be stored on it. Think of it as an all-in-one search that not only searches the web, but searches your device as well as giving you recommendations based on your recently used apps.Aside from software, the main reason why I have always used Pixel phones is the camera. While the Pixel 7 does have some improvements to the larger sensor, all of the magic still happens on the software processing side. Even photos that may not look like they will be good before pressing the shutter, will look like a professional photo as soon as it is captured and finished processing. This is what the Pixel does best. No matter what phone I use, whether Android-wise or iPhone, the photos produced by the Pixel series are still the best I've ever seen and used. Photos just pop with a well balanced blend of saturation, color, lighting, and sharpness that looks natural to real life. Selfies are the same as well. Despite the front selfie camera being a lower megapixel camera compared to the rear sensor, it still produces great photos and the portrait mode is one of the best on a smartphone. However, while the Pixel 7 captures great photos, it still needs some work on the video side. Videos are an improvement over previous generations, but videos still need a lot of light to look good. When in a well-lit room or outside on a sunny day, the videos are vivid, detailed, clear, and sharp, but as soon as the lights start to dim, the videos will return to a noisy mess. For videos, the iPhone still remains supreme, in my opinion, but the next gen Pixel just might close the gap on the video side.When it comes to battery life, it is a bit of a mixed bag. The Pixel 7 had very mediocre battery life in the first day or two that I had it, with it not lasting more than 4-5 hours on a full charge for me. However, by day 3, the battery life nearly doubled as the adaptive battery feature noticed the apps I was using and optimized itself for a better experience. The phone charges at an average rate and still doesn't charge very fast over wired or wireless chargers, but it is still good enough to fully charge it in a bit over an hour when plugged in directly.When it comes to performance, the Tensor 2 is a powerhouse, but it still doesn't even come close to the newer Snapdragon Flagship chips from the last couple of years. Games can still be a bit stuttery and laggy at times, and you may have to lower some settings for a smooth experience. However, it is still a very capable chip and I would still say it is 2nd best after the Snapdragon.The display is something that is still a mixed bag as although I received a defective unit with my ""gray zones'', the OLED panel used on the non-Pro variants still continues to be much lower quality than the LTPO panels used on the Pro version. While the refresh rate can still go up to 90Hz and is a significant improvement over 60Hz panels, my primary complaint is actually about the fact that the brightness is significantly lower even at max levels and has way more noticeable color shifting when tilting the phone screen to the sides. While it is an OLED panel that still delivers vibrant colors and rich blacks, I just wish it had at least a 1st gen LTPO panel or a higher quality AMOLED than what is being used. While these complaints may seem unwarranted because my display was defective, this was an issue with the Pixel 6 as well when it came to using a lower quality panel compared to the Pro. As someone who has also used the A-series of Pixel phones, the displays on those budget options are nearly identical in quality to the Pixel 7, just with a faster refresh rate on 7 itself.Overall, while the phone itself is still the best value for the money, I was disappointed that my brand new unit had such a big flaw with the display. I've never had this issue with Pixel phones before and it really impacted my opinion of Google's quality for the time being. Aside from that, I still highly recommend this phone to those who want a nearly full flagship phone experience but without spending more than is needed. In terms of photos and software, it is the best there is, but for gaming, productivity, and videos, it still needs some improvements.",Pixel Phones are Still King but Mine Had Flaws,2023-09-10,4.0,R1OH3858AUS7SZ,TJ,108.0,"Update 2/19/23. So last update Amazon graciously gave me a very fair partial refund even though it was outside the 2 month window. (I owned the phone for 4 mos and 2 days) And I have sent the pixel 7 back to them. Google customer service continues to be abysmal. Overall phone was not better than pixel 2 for me, but aside from all my issues still a decent value and I still like Pixel phones better than the competition. Read on if you desire to see my trials and tribulations with the Pixel 7. So I finally got around to working through the warranty process (for cracked rear camera lens) with Google and was put in touch with a local ubreakit/wefixit shop who promptly told me it wasn't covered(incidental damage). I was quoted $249 to repair. I declined and contacted Amazon again who proceeded to offer me a very fair partial refund which I accepted and sent the phone back. I am back to using my pixel 2 which still works better for me, while I regroup and figure out what is next. Thanks Amazon you are absolutely fantastic you didn't have to make this right and you did, so thanks,  and if you make a smartphone I would love to buy it. Google customer service your lucky I still like the pixel because you are absolutely atrocious to work with.Update 1/14/23 on the plus side it appears that the USB c port issues were software related, it stopped having issues after the last update. So that is a win.I contacted Amazon about the broken camera lens it appears this is a common issue on Pixel 7s due to a manufacturing error in producing the glass. Apparently they shatter due to internal stress. Amazon told me that they couldn't help me because it was outside the 2 month return window. But it has a one year warranty by Google. I reached out to Google for the warranty claim and I received an email from a company lawyer saying if I was sueing them about the issue they have received my information and would email me back. I haven't heard anything since. I imagine I will have to contact them again. But only the wide angle camera is affected and I don't use that. So overall I am actually pretty happy with this phone. And now that the USB c port works again it does everything I need. I hear pixel 8 is smaller so will see when that one comes out. Adding a star because everything I care about works now. Google customer service sucks, but still wouldn't pay $1200 for a comparable iphone or Samsung.Update 12/3/22I have started having issues with the USB C port it doesn't grab the cable tightly and causes issues with Android auto and often if I attempt to charge by cable it will appear to be charging and than won't. I have cleaned it out, but no obvious debris. I bought this first day available and received it October 17, so not quite two months. I have worked around this using a wireless charger but still data xfer and android auto are a problem.Additionally I bought and use a Spigen case and screen protector, but I pulled it out of my pocket and found the glass shattered above the camera lens.  I am guessing that I leaned against something with it in my pocket but I didn't drop it or violate it in an obvious manner.  I definitely need a phone that I can carry in my pocket and that is adequately protected with a case and screen protector although a nice phone maybe not durable enough for me. Never had an issue with pixel 2 on the durability front.Fortunately both the camera and phone still work but definitely not tracking for another four year performance.Original review -I have been using this phone for a little over a month. I upgraded from a pixel 2.Pros- Good battery life, updates and is supported for the next 3 years.Cons-Significantly larger than pixel 2, fingerprint scanner is almost unusable.There is a lot of reviews on the cameras and how great they are, I'm sure they are excellent for my uses the pixel 2 was more than adequate and this one is also more than adequate.The fingerprint reader is a problem, the pixel 2 worked almost flawlessly for the 4 years I used it every day. The pixel 7 might work 2 out of 10 times maybe 1 out of ten, it is so inconsistent that I really can't use it for biometric authentication. I have read the fixes and troubleshooting, none of it really works, I'm not going to carry a fingerprint wetter around with me.I think a lot of the things that drove me to upgrade, were do to Google refusing to support the Pixel 2 it received its last update at the end of 2020 and it started a few months ago to experience buggy performance with connectivity and the GPS, with no real fixes due to being two revs behind on Android.For me the fingerprint scanner and size combined with a brand new pixel 2, makes it a better phone than the pixel 7. Unfortunately I can't go back in time and can only hope that in four years pixel 12 is smaller and has a functional fingerprint scanner.The 7 is a good phone and at $500 it is an excellent value. They certainly have upgraded the cameras and the tensor system works well. I certainly am glad I went this route over the other options.I just think there is a point where some of the driving features, cameras, operating systems, weird swipe modes etc are really not noticeably better and drive up cost and size and lead to removal of things I would like such as a stand alone fingerprint scanner and 3.5 mm jack. Hope Google reads this","Amazon is excellent, Google customer service not so much.",2022-11-16,3.0

My review:Size: this phone is at least 30% larger than my old phone. Fortunately I do not carry it around often so it probably won't be a major issue. However, if you are looking for a portable phone that will fit in a regular pocket, be aware.Set up: tracfone support was useless. They wanted to send me a code to complete the set up, but my old phone was broken so they said they could not, nor did they offer any other options. Fortunately, my adult son switched the sim card from my old phone into the new one and i was able to receive the code on my new phone and complete the process. Without him I would still not have a functional phone.Charging cable: phone did not come with a functional charging cable and to use the one that was sent would have required another purchase. I ended up using the cable from my Fire tablet, which sufficed.Performance: as always there is a learning curve with new technology but so far i am feeling my way along with this phone. Don't expect to receive a user manual because one does not come with this phone. Downloaded one from the internet but it is poorly written and not user friendly. You Tube videos are available for some issues, however. So far the phone seems to be working ok.Lost data: i am still trying to figure out if I can retrieve my contacts, photos, etc from my old phone to transfer to new phone. I probably won't even bother to do this thru tracfone because I'm sure it would only frustrate me and make me want to kill myself.

It's got a surprisingly good screen. The 90hz setting makes it pretty smooth and the colors and brightness are decent. It fades pretty fast at angles, but I'm not going to get picky about that for $150 (it was on sale).As far as performance, it's really good.

The camera is pretty good too, not flagship quality, but far from a potato. It's got a mono speaker which is lacking a bit in bass, but unless you've got an iPhone I think every phone is going to be lacking there.So, if you've got $200 to spend (or less as I got it at a $50 discount here on Amazon), this is an amazingly good bargain.

I made a mistake buying this one and I don't think anyone should buy this phone. I swapped it for the Samsung S23, so I'll compare it with that in this review. It's $250 more, which I did NOT want to pay. I'm not a spender, but I guarantee you, save up some more and treat yourself better. You use your phone every day, trust me you want a better one than the 7a.(1) Battery life and charging. awful. This is the main reason you don't want this phone. This phone has 18W wired charging (roughly 2 hours to charge) and 7.5W wireless charging (roughly 4 hours to charge). The battery lasts about 4-5 hours. If you are like most people and use your phone for 2-4 hours a day, this phone WILL die before nighttime. Do you always want to carry a charger? Do you want the anxiety of worrying when you don't have a charger? Even if you think you'll be fine, what might start as a decent battery will be unusable after 18-24 months of use. That'll be an $100 new battery or entirely new phone.Pixel 7a: 18W wired charging and 7.5 wireless. Battery endurance test: 76hrSamsung S23: 25W wired charging and 15W wireless. Battery endurance test: 101hrComically, the Samsung S23 has a 12.5% SMALLER battery, yet lasts 32% longer.(2) Speed of the device. Google makes its own processors, with the Tensor 2 chip in this one. I expected very good performance given that it's the same processor they use in their Google Pixel  7 Pro phone. The processor is FINE for most things, but gaming is subpar. As a normal user you could get by with this, but just know it's SLOW and KILLS THE BATTERY. I used Geekbench, an app that determines phone performance, to compare this with the S23.Pixel 7a (Google Tensor 2 chip): 3191S23 (Snapdragon Gen 2 chip): 4950 (155% difference)Here's the GFXBench score, a frames-per-second stress test that shows game performance:Pixel 7a: 62fpsS23: 110fps (177% difference)(3) Cameras: excellent, of course. Pixels have some of the best cameras in the industry. You might think this phone is worth it for the cameras and it is, so long as you have a charger with you everywhere.Pixel 7a: Ultrawide and regular camera. Takes pictures that look less premium, but are more true to life and have the best detail. The camera also comes with some crazy AI editing features that Google loves to advertise.S23: Ultrawide, regular, and telephoto (3x zoom) camera. Takes pictures you might expect from a professional camera. Very contrasty, lots of colors, better camera performance. As an amateur photographer, I prefer the S23 because I like color and contrasty.(4) Software. Both these phones will have 3-5 years of upgrades, thanks to new Google and Samsung policies. Google Pixels have the best of the best Android features, simply because Google owns Android. Samsung uses a modified version of Android called One UI (5.1). This one is up for personal preference. One UI has WAY more features, controls, settings, etc, but it can be a little intimidating. Most people either love or hate Samsung's One UI.In summary--------------I spent the $250 more for the Samsung S23. The 7a was one of the worst phones I've ever owned and the S23 is hands-down the best phone I've ever owned. The price really hurts your wallet, but if you use your phone every day, the little things add up. You might think you can live with the awful battery of the 7a, but after a year or two I guarantee you, you'll want it replaced. Would you rather buy a new phone/battery in two years or buy a better phone today that might last you 3-5 years? You'll save money AND have a better phone.Please, please do not buy the 7a. The S23 might not be the right price for everyone, but look at these alternatives before you make the mistake of buying the 7a:- Samsung S23, a flagship, best of the best, but much more expensive.- Google Pixel 6a, last year's model. Better battery, slightly worse cameras, much cheaper.- Google Pixel 7, almost a year old and can probably get it for a similar price. Larger, better cameras, better battery.- Samsung A54, the mid-range Samsung. Comparable performance to the Pixel 7a with better battery but worse cameras and trade-offs in other areas.","Horrific battery life, be cautious before you buy",2023-06-30,2.0

The macro lense never takes quite crisp enough pictures. The main cameras zoom is grainy and pixelated. The main cameras video doesn't have good stabilization software2) trying to change media output is a pain compared to other phones, leaving you swiping the tray down twice, clicking a menu, clicking media output, and finally able to change it3) you can't change the shortcuts on the lock screen for some reason4) it is hard to disable the Google feed screen which I personally find useless. You have to disable the entire Google app. This was an issue on the N100 as well.5) after the last system update their ""red cable club"" app, is no longer in the app menu and cannot be uninstalled or disabled, and thus it is requesting updates when I will NEVER use it.6) after the same update, the Shelf (a secondary tray essentially) which was useful at first due to the pedometer and ability to add extra widgets like Wundergrounds weather, suddenly you can't use any custom widgets and the remaining options all suck, so it's an entire tray with one useful app... Aka, as good as useless.7) No MicroSD slot for the sole purpose of trying to force you to pay more for the next level sub-model. This is becoming a common practice, but it remains a BS one. It would be like a new TV not coming with any inputs, to try and force you to buy the higher model that has a built in Xbox console. You upgrade and get the Xbox and streaming apps, but you better hope you never want a blu-ray player or PS2. In this case it makes it a complete pain in the ass to transfer videos and photos or to clean them up on a larger screen, as the cable connection on phones has always been clunky compared to swapping a MicroSD.1+ OxygenOS is a love hate thing.

As a long time user of Samsung and Pixel phones on the Android side of things, this is honestly a better phone in almost every way possible- aside from that camera.The unit I received was brand new as described, and it was in perfect working condition. I was able to easily add my SIM card to it and transfer my Google Fi number to this phone in just a few minutes. (Note, this phone does not support eSIM, so you will need a physical SIM card to set it up.) The setup was also very easy and simple to do and has the same data and app transfer option as on other android devices.Once set up, it was still on Android 12 by default, but I did have a large series of updates that took about an hour to fully get it up to the latest release of Android 13. The phone had approximately 7 updates in this time frame.Software:Once fully updated, OxygenOS was a breath of fresh air. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was using a version of Android that was more customizable than ever as well as giving the default Android-like experience a whole new form. OxygenOS was cleaner and more modern than any other Android skin I've seen, with a translucent app and notification drawer, subtle icon animations when expanding the quick settings, and so much more. Even the built-in clock has a red color for the ""1"" digits as a subtle nod to OnePlus itself. While the entire skin feels smoother than any Android experience I have ever had, it is also the most customizable. You can change the icons to a number of different shapes, sizes, styles, and colors and the same goes for the software color themes, home page screen transitions, the always on display, and even the battery icon style itself. It's an endlessly adjustable software to reflect the style you like the most and I really, really like that. When it comes to ringtones it even has a much higher amount of ringtones I've ever seen preloaded on a phone, and the haptics are out of this world as each ringtone has haptics that respond identically to the tune that is playing. It's just that great and I haven't even mentioned the side quick app drawer or the shelf features. Also, despite being a physical switch, the phone also has a three-way slider above the power button that can instantly switch your phone between Ring, Haptic, and Silent modes as well as muting your audio automatically. It's similar to the silent mode switch on an iPhone but better, in my opinion.Performance:When it comes to performance I was very impressed. Despite the fact that I got the 8GB of RAM model, the phone was snappy and blazing fast. Apps launched in no time and apps scrolled with perfect butter-y action with that 120Hz display. My games were lag free in all that I tried and I am just overall very pleased with the performance.Display:In this phone is an LTPO gen 2 OLED panel that is one of the best I've seen aside from a Samsung phone. Not only is it able to automatically adjust its frame rate to conserve battery life, but it does it in a way that you wouldn't otherwise notice. There is no hitching or stuttering or weird glitches from the display shifting its frame rate and it is just a flawless experience. Not only that, the display is incredibly vivid, detailed, and bright and I didn't notice any color shifting like on some lower quality OLED panels. The HDR looks great, and the screen is super immersive. You will not be disappointed when playing games or watching content as it is one of the best displays I have seen. However, I am not the biggest fan of the curved edges as I prefer a flat display but the edges of the display are not too troublesome or as curved as some others.Battery Life:At first I was slightly worried that the battery wasn't going to be good as despite its exceptionally fast charging speeds, my phone was depleting charge extremely fast the first few days that I had it. In the days since, the battery has held up much better with somedays giving me as much as triple the screen on time compared to when I first got it. I assume that this is from the adaptive battery functionality finally optimizing itself based on how I use my phone and what apps I run, but it is something to take note of as you must give the phone a few days to get this kind of battery life. Presently, I am able to use it all day with about 30% charge left around bedtime. Now, the most standout feature about this phone is its charging capabilities. From a near 0 charge, this phone can almost completely get back to 100% in just 30 minutes which is crazy to me as I am used to phones taking anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours to fully charge. So, if you just need a quick charge, just plug this in for a few minutes and you'll get a couple hours of screen time. It's that fast. If you prefer to charge wirelessly, it will also support insanely fast wireless charge speeds, but you have to make sure your wireless charger is capable of putting out the necessary wattage.Speakers:The speakers on this phone are very good. While they don't get as loud as I would like, they do deliver fuller and more natural sounding audio compared to other phones I have used. Voices sound crisp and clear, and music sounds detailed and rich. The only disappointment I have with the speaker aside from the volume level is that the bass is not very noticeable, but this isn't that much of an issue to me. The speakers deliver what I would describe as a mostly ""flat"" or otherwise balanced sound EQ.Build Quality:This is also without a doubt one of the most comfortable phones I have ever used. Even though I usually put a case on all of my devices, this is probably the only one I would consider using without one. The back of the phone has this unusual but incredibly well done powdered granite-like feel as the frosted matte finish is soft and soothing against the hands. It doesn 2019t look or feel like glass at all as it feels more like a soft stone, and the best part is this finish doesn 2019t leave fingerprints of any kind which means you don 2019t need to constantly wipe it down. It also gives it a slight amount of grip to hold as it isn 2019t slippery. Despite not being a fan of curved edges, the design of the phone is not too narrow or too wide which allows it to fit almost perfectly in my hands as if it was naturally designed for them. The phone is also very light weight despite all that is packed inside of it, and I just really think the design, feel and weight of the phone is one of the best I have ever used.Camera:We are finally at the weakest part of the entire phone. Despite the Hasselblad partnership, the cameras on this phone just can't quite live up to the photos taken on other Android phones such as the Pixel series or Galaxy Ultra phones. It gets even worse when you compare the selfie cameras as the photos taken by this phone are extremely soft and lack detail. While the rear camera can still take some fairly good photos, it is more of a ""luck of the draw"" as sometimes it will capture a good photo and other times it will not. Videos are even worse. While most android phones have never really been that good when it comes to video, there is something noticeably wrong with the videos I record with this phone. It's like all the saturation got turned up to a 1000 as the colors are way over done compared to real life in addition to all the shadow details being crushed with nothing but pure black. It's still usable to make a quick post, but I would not recommend using it to record videos for content creation. Overall, it is not the worst camera by any means as it is still fairly good, but it just doesn't live up to my expectations.Overall, this is an excellent phone that when on sale, I would say is better than almost anything else aside from the camera. At the current sub-500 cost, the performance, battery life, display quality, and software experience is unrivaled. The only thing that hurts the value in my opinion is the camera, but it excels in almost every other category. I highly recommend it.",Better than Almost Every Flagship Phone,2023-09-10,4.0,R2QXDXGCOFG39C,three_legs,2.0,"First off I like this camera. 30x is actually amazing.However, without access to MSM and edl firehose etc I am kinda disappointed.Basically if you brick your device doing any development there are two options open it up to do a hardware jumper bypass or send it back to OnePlus. The new MSM tool uses a unique key pair for each phone that links to oopos servers for the private key. So you need oopo credentials. While I'm sure someone will find a way eventually I'm not able to provide much in the way of research with my current situation. Their merger with oopo has been a failure there's things that I just can't tolerate with oos like the relatively weak encryption and security standards. Which are admittably Android standard. I apologize to Amazon but I'll have to send this one back I'll probably be buying an even older OnePlus.",Read if you're a developer.,2023-06-17,3.0

I called technical support and was walked through a soft and hard reset, neither of which fixed the problem.I was told that it was still under warranty and should send it in. I had to PAY $20 upfront for shipping. At that point I should've seen where this was going but didn't expect a large company selling on Amazon to try and scam me.I sent the phone in as instructed and waited. After a week of hearing nothing I checked the status of the device online and there was a note that the phone was out of warranty due to internal water damage that caused system failure. The phone has never been in contact with water, and system failure wasn't even the issue. Everything worked fine and I was guided through resets. The camera would just not work. The online status said I'd have to pay $130 for repair.I called at least 3 times over the next week and was read the note about system failure (though their so called linked proof documents were BLANK). I was told that the issue had been escalated and a supervisor would call on 2 of the occasions, but noone ever called.The last straw was the call where I was told that if I don't agree to pay the $130 repair cost, I would still have to pay the technicians fee to have the phone returned to me.

You expect me to pay a fee to the incompetent technician who claimed that my phone (that worked fine except for the camera when I sent it to you) had internal water damage and the system failed?

As they say, ""You get what you pay for,"" and this phone perfectly embodies that sentiment. If you're looking for a budget-friendly device that covers the basics, the A03 might be an option to consider. However, be prepared to deal with its frustratingly sluggish performance.Pros: 2705 Budget-Friendly: One of the most appealing aspects of the Samsung A03 is undoubtedly its price. It's a wallet-friendly option for those who need a smartphone but don't want to break the bank. 2705 Decent Display: The display is adequate for everyday tasks such as checking emails, browsing social media, and watching videos. The colors are decent, and the screen size is comfortable.Cons: 274c Sluggish Performance: The most significant drawback of the A03 is its painfully slow performance. Apps take forever to open, switching between tasks is a test of patience, and even simple actions like typing can lead to frustrating delays. This sluggishness significantly hampers the overall user experience. 274c Limited Storage: The internal storage on the A03 is quite limited, leaving you with minimal space for apps, photos, and other files. You'll likely find yourself constantly juggling storage to make room for new content. 274c Mediocre Camera: While I didn't expect flagship-level camera quality from a budget phone, the A03's camera still falls short. Photos lack detail and tend to look washed out, especially in low-light conditions. 274c Outdated Software: The A03 comes with an older version of Samsung's software, and updates are infrequent. This not only means missing out on the latest features but also leaves you vulnerable to security risks.Overall Impression:The Samsung A03 is a prime example of the trade-off between price and performance. If you're on a tight budget and need a device for the bare minimum tasks like calls, texts, and occasional browsing, the A03 might serve its purpose. However, if you're looking for a smoother experience, even for basic tasks, I'd recommend saving up a bit more for a more capable phone. The sluggishness and limited features of the A03 can quickly become frustrating, overshadowing its affordable price point.

For example attempting to do the return through Amazon app I ended up staring at an all white screen for about a minute before I gave up, rebooted and tried again.Also if I'm running Spotify in the background or get a phone call, no apps want to work afterwards.

Thank you, Elena!",27.0,R3NM64B2SRXFAV,Cynthia Castillo,52.0,"While I do plan to go back to Google Pixel in the future, I will say I have mostly very positive things to say about the phone. I will go into detail about the flaws I noticed. I am using the Google Pixel 3 as reference as that was my last phone before I had to rush to buy this one due to having it stolen.First off, let's start with the pros:PROSGreat Battery life - way better than on the Google Pixel (3).Has a solid build and feel to it - Not quite rugged phone level (unless you get the right case for it.) but it has a sleek design that looks simple but very appealing.Able to uninstall pre loaded apps with no issues.Works with the listed carriers, including way more as long as they fit the requirements. (I am on US mobile and it works fine on there.)Options to save the battery - My pixel had battery saving mode but the one on this phone is extreme and if you keep it on there, it's similar to having a rugged phone with a large battery size. It's pretty nice.Transitions are smooth unless a LOT of apps are running - a tiny (And I mean tiny) bit of lag here and there, but it's to be expected.Headphone jacks - you can use an SD card on this phone - the camera is almost as good as the Google Pixel 3 or 4 (HDR mode) - And of course it comes unlocked.Now we will go to the cons. Keep in mind that I have been rocking the google pixel series phone for almost 4 years. I always compare any phone that I need short term or considering for long term before making a choice. As of this time, I will keep this phone long term until I can afford the latest Google Pixel phone.CONSGames (Raid is one example) must either be set to MED. or below settings or (Like Pokemon Go) the game assets (basically EVERYTHING in the game) would need to be pre-downloaded beforehand. I am only pointing this out because there are a number of gamers that due game on the android platform. From what I notice, sometimes the FPS dips a bit when there are too many things on screen. Very noticeable animation lag. On 2D or simple games, this is NOT an issue. But keep this in mind.Slower download/upload speeds - You will notice it when trying to load a page with a lot of content, or say the reddit app. Even on Wifi, while loads faster, still slower.SLOW CHARGING - I am putting this in caps so that way people know. So this does NOT have fast charging. This is something that I actually miss from my pixel. Now, I do not know if I would need to get a different type of charger or cable but from what I read and have seen, it does not fast charge. It charges a bit slowly, it could be due to the larger battery. But just something to be aware of.Speakers are at the bottom of the phone - This is a con for me. But something to be aware of.Only a year of updates.BOTTOM LINE: If you need an new phone, with *almost* the same performance as a google pixel 3 or 4 if it's just to get you by until you buy your main phone, your kid, your parents, etc I highly recommend this phone. With a good hybrid case, you have yourself a rugged phone that is better than 90% of the ""rugged phones"" that are out there. With a normal thin case, it feels light and slim. It's a very solid option. I just hope they can put in a more powerful chip or even throw on more ram so that way it runs games and apps a lot faster.",Almost as good as a previous genration Google Pixel (3 or 4),2023-04-28,5.0,RS645LNUW5RLA,KingRelex,0.0,"This phone will still have 60% battery life at the end of day after a full day of use.  This is so much better than any iphone or other android I've ever had.  Only bad thing is the computing power isn't that great.  The lag in some games when there's lots of action is VERY bad, to where it bogs down to like 1 FPS.  Otherwise, it's an amazing phone for under $100.",Amazing battery life!,2023-09-14,3.0

Trying to locate a compatible charging cord for at home, I did, but was displayed that it was  201cslow charging 201d and to  201cuse the proper charger 201d.  d83e dee4  I felt anxious to see it work, there not being many compatible phones for Tello service with a T-Mobile connection.

As mentioned, the charging cable was missing, AND the other items.

I was told I would need to send back to get another phone sent, in order to be refunded.  The thing is, I did not want to fiddle with the Sim sent by Tello, in case it could get damaged, then would need THAT replaced, also.  After speaking to Amazon, was told that I could get a slight refund.  So, I unknowingly paid $108.41 for a refurb. phone sent by the seller, yet those being listed at $48.00.  This is the first time I have had an issue like this and not too happy.  d83d de12So, the phone itself seems okay, I like that navigating is quick, the phone being smaller and more lightweight, the features being straightforward, and the overall look is fine.  I was initially overshadowed by the product-receiving issue, and was unsure about the phone.  After getting a proper charging cord, I saw that it charges more quickly, seems to last a bit for my needs.  The phone seems fine, I am just angry at the seller - LincolnWood or something, for the mishap.","It was received without a charger..phone seems not bad, review is overshadowed by sender error.",2023-05-28,3.0

ITS AMAZING. BUY THIS PHONE, THE PRICE IS WORTH IT. Seriously. I'm so extremely elated to own a tiny phone like this that can do most everything I expected from it.To start, the screen. It's tiny, yes, but it's also looks pretty good. Peel off the manufacturer's fuzzy screen protector, and you have a serviceable screen. At that size, you need a high enough resolution that gives you clarity, and this phone delivers. Also, the text all seem to be manipulated by a custom android OS made to give legibility and formatting to work on the small screen. Chrome and other apps were all sized and formatted in a way that everything was easy to read, no need to zoom.You might think typing is difficult on the screen, but my secret weapon for you is Gboard. Download the keyboard from the Play store, and turn on Glide. Boom, you can now swipe/Swype/glide with ease. I typed my typical book-long messages to my viewers in Discord with ease. Hangouts? No issues. Side note: there is a custom keyboard in it, it might have glide/Swype, but I didn't use it. Gboard is my jam, so I went with that.I downloaded quite a few apps for this phone, and some intensive games. They all ran acceptably, but a few stuttered. Honestly, if you want to game hardcore, you're looking at the wrong phone. Emulating with a Bluetooth controller, though? Chefs kiss, babay, it handles the classics of the 16 bit era quite well. Definitely a nice teeny pocket handheld. And, hey, Alto's Adventure ran beautifully.Quick tip: use Nova Launcher and give it a more traditional Android look, it'll make the phone feel more complete. It runs perfectly with a custom launcher.The typical features of a phone were all FINE on this. Great volume, strong vibrate, the Bluetooth worked wonderfully to make this an MP3 player, and so on. The cameras on the front and back are pretty low quality in low light, but they snapped acceptable pics. You'll be wanting a different device for higher quality photos, come on. Battery life is great. Full charge in an hour, idled on for three days without dying. I left it sitting at 75 percent, from me playing on it for about 45 minutes. It might not be an all day phone using it nonstop, but the faster charge is nice.Phone calls were great. If you don't want to hold a tiny phone, use Bluetooth. I used it, with zero issue, perfect call quality. Any bad areas in town were still bad areas with this phone, but that's to be expected.Oh, also, it came with all the goodies. A screen protector. Charging cable. Sim card slot puller. AND A CUTE LITTLE CASE.I use a Note 20 Ultra as my daily phone. I used this for 5 days straight, and will keep carrying it around, along with that behemoth. I'm in love with it. It's ridiculous, you know this. But, it's actually serviceable, if you need a small alternative. Will it fit every situation? Maybe not. But it'll most likely fill yours, if you're here. The price is about right, in my humble opinion.I will be posting a video of my time with it elsewhere, keep an eye out for Havok Versus Everything, or find me just to chat. I will yell about how much I love this thing.If you have any more questions, ask in the question section and I will answer the best I can.

I then signed up for a TracFone plan. I purchased the unlimited talk and text, and 2 GB plan. The reason I went with TracFone is because they have rollover minutes. My typical use of data is 1 GB per month. Therefore I thought I would be rolling over 1 GB each month. I just paid for my February plan on the 28th, so I should have 2 GB and whatever's left for rollover. I currently have .69 rollover GB  and zero new GB. At the bare minimum, I should have 2 GB of new data. And maybe 4 GB of rollover.I received a message that my phone had been unlocked, or was available to be unlocked, after 60 days of having my phone. I don't know if it's unlocked or not. I'm ready to move my phone to a different plan so I can get what I pay for, but the customer service is atrocious for TracFone.I first tried chatting online. I was number 86 in the queue, I waited. The person answered my question that I had .69 GB of data. I asked another question, and he was gone.So I called customer service and waited 25 minutes, the girl came on the phone and I asked her if she could first tell me when did I start my service with tracfone. She informed me she could not give me that information. I was confused! I asked her why she can't she said it's a policy. I said how then am I supposed to know if I have the right amount of rollover minutes. And she said it's a policy I can't tell you. I said well I have another question... And she cut me off.The phone rang, and it rang two rings I couldn't answer it quick enough and it was dead. My guess was that was them calling me back.I kept trying to call them back but it would get answered and then cut off, right away. No human no automated voice. I waited 40 minutes, and then I called again. This time the call went through, I waited 18 minutes. I got a guy named Bill on the phone, he told me you couldn't help me cuz his computer was down. I called again. I got a very helpful lady who told me that my balance was .69 GB. I explained to her that I just purchased 2 GB on February 28th and it's not showing in my system. She came back and was in the middle of answering me and we got cut off. I called back after waiting a long period of time I talked to another person, the system was down and he couldn't help me.I then did a chat through the app. That guy was pretty helpful... But then he got stuck because his system went down.I'm moving my service.... Don't get TracFone! Check out other reviews before you decide. You'll see I'm not the only one having troubles with the rollover minutes. Problem is I didn't read the reviews before I started my adventure with TracFone.Good luck.",Buyer beware,2023-03-05,1.0

Really annoying is that it never actually closes any apps, and it has a bunch of apps it always opens, whether you want them to open or not. Especially Google apps, which they also won't let you delete or even ""park.""  So you'll need to download an app killer and run it regularly.  Right now there are 35 open apps. About 5 of which I didn't use.  That may be Android, but it's on their phone.Big plus is battery and charging.  This thing is a beast.  Two full days of power, even with Zoom meetings, texting, and browsing.  Recharges in minutes, not hours.  About 75% in less than an hour.  Maybe 90 for a full charge.  I almost wish it wasn't so nicely built and good looking.  I don't dare risk not using a gel case, in case I might hurt it!I had to torture myself to spend $230 on this - and I'm glad I did.  If I were willing to spend $900+ on a phone, I'd buy a OnePlus in a minute.  I'm not, but if OnePlus would like me to review their latest model...",Feels like a better phone than you should get for the price.,2023-08-21,4.0,R2FY1D6HGI0BT4,D T,16.0,"Pros:- micro SD slot- 3.5mm headphone jack- Easily unlockable bootloader- Easily rootable- Still receiving security updates- Generally decent hardware all around- Camera takes decent quality photos & videos- Works well with T-Mobile's networks, including 5G- Pretty responsive for the most part, with occasional minor lag Cons:- Overly aggressive task killer, and it's a *major* con- Software in general, is subpar- Price - $150 would be more reasonable, unless the software is improved- Fingerprint scanner is under screen - in my experience, these aren't as responsive as ones on a power button, or other dedicated hardware location- Front camera location could be better.  I like to cover my camera with tape when I'm not using it, and it's more difficult to do that when the camera is inside the screen - as in, the screen is displaying stuff around the camera lens.  I'd prefer a camera that's under the screen, and but is not displaying anything above it, so it's easier to tape up.Review:I've always avoided OnePlus, because despite their motto of ""Never Settle"", their major lineup has always seemed exactly like settling to me - no microSD slot, nor 3.5mm headphone jack, nor NFC, and other missing basic features, even before the industry sadly started killing some those features off in most phones.  Unfortunately, it's been harder to find phones that meet some of my basic criteria that I just mentioned.  So while I was looking for a new phone, I was pretty interested in trying a OnePlus phone that finally had those things.  For the most part, the phone works great. Rooting was easy enough. The phone is still getting security updates. Calls are clear.  Camera quality is not great, but not terrible. The phone does run a little slow at times, but is pretty responsive for the most part.  HOWEVER, there's a major problem, in my opinion, with the software.  It is the sole reason for me knocking 2 of the stars off. The phone's task killer is stupidly aggressive.  If you don't know, this is the thing on Android that usually manages what apps you have running on your phone, in the foreground and in the background. Whatever app you're looking at & using, is likely in the foreground.  Whatever apps are running, but you're not actively using, such as a music or video player, is likely in the background.  On this phone, that thing is so aggressive, that I can seldom have one app running in the background, let alone more than that.  Trying to play music from a music player, while trying to browse the internet?  Expect your music player in the background to get slaughtered within a few minutes, because the phone's task killer won't allow it.  Switching between 2-3 apps while multi-tasking?  1 or 2 of them will likely get killed, probably resetting whatever you were doing in them.  As you might guess from my comment about rooting, I'm a power user.  I know my way around Android probably way better than the average user.  Before I even rooted, I was suffering from this issue.  I've tried setting every option in the phone that I could find, to not kill certain apps in the background.  Yet none of them seem to have any effect on disabling this ""feature"".  There are root-only solutions for this type of issue, but they also don't fix the problem on this phone. From hours of researching online, I'm not the only one with this complaint.  It seems like whatever is causing this aggressive task killer behavior, is ingrained deep in OnePlus's badly designed operating system. From what I've read, this aggressive task killing behavior is also oddly normal for OnePlus's operating systems on most of their phones, which I wish I would've known before buying this phone.  Also, the music player is just one example.  There are various other apps that I like to setup to run in the background and do certain things.  And they keep closing & failing, because of the overly aggressive task killer.  I think maybe it's OnePlus's way of hiding the phone's slow performance, by not allowing anything in the background to slow it down.  It is such a massive shame, because this one major issue, absolutely ruins the phone for me.  $300 for a phone with an issue like this, is an absurd price. I think $150 is more reasonable, until this issue is fixed.  I've used plenty of $100 phones, that work better, without the need to kill apps so aggressively. Some of the customizability options in the OnePlus system's settings are also more limited than the average Android phone that I've used, so the software just seems to be poorly designed in general.I really want to support companies that continue producing phones with micro SD cards, 3.5mm headphone jacks, easy rootability, heck, removable batteries, if we could get those back.  Those features are becoming harder & harder to find, and I consider them essential, far more than some gimmick on other phones, like a 100MP camera, or having 4 camera lens. But unfortunately, despite the decent hardware on the OnePlus Nord, the software still very much feels like settling.","Decent hardware, horrible software",2023-05-28,2.0

The phone is light weight, could be a pro or con for you. The camera lenses are sleek, they are not ugly and bulky like some of the other cheap phones. The camera quality is acceptable.

The phone is plastic but that's not noticeable once you put a case on it anyway. The phone speed is fast enough. It's not too glitchy. The main drawback for me is the lower screen quality than other phones in it's price range like the umidigi. The screen almost appears faded. My usual phone is a Samsung Galaxy s 22+. The umidigi had a surprisingly similar screen quality for such a cheap phone. Whereas, this doogee has about what you would expect from $100 phone. The screen looks grainy a bit and the color hues are off. I also don't like that the time display area at the top left of the screen is partially cut off. It is misaligned. So you can't see the top of the number. It's still functional I guess because I can still tell what time is displayed but it represents a quality and design issue to me. Also, when the case is on it the fingerprint reader accuracy is decreased. Due to the placing. The speaker volume is good. The phone seemed unable to maintain as good as a connection to my wifi as other devices.

I've had this phone for nearly 4 years, and it replaced the original Moto Z.  As you might surmise, I like the Moto line of phones.My criteria for a new phone was simple:1. Must have +6GB RAM2. Must have +128GB of internal storage3. Must have micro SD storage capability4. Must have excellent battery capacity5. Must have earphone jack6. Must have a decent processor7. Must have Android no more than on version old.8. Must be OEM unlocked for the USA9. Must not require a second mortgage to purchase.10. Must be 5G capable.With the plethora of phones out on the market, you'd think there would be countless options...but no, there aren't.  The one phone I kept coming back to during my months long research was the Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G.I finally pulled the trigger a week ago and, after seven days of real world use, I have to say that I am impressed and pleased.  The phone runs smoothly and performs all of the needed tasks I need throughout the day: email, texting web searches, phone calls and maybe some twittering along the way.I've noticed only a few stutters along the way, when I've had 20 web pages loaded in Chrome, for instance and constantly switching from one tab to another.  The processor on this phone is a Snapdragon 750G, which is very capable but, like any thing, if you overload it, it may show some slight stutter when scrolling, but it has been rare and not really an issue for me.Now...the battery.  Impressive!  I use the phone most heavily in the morning as I begin my day.  I'm up at 7 a.m. and by noon I was at 78% capacity.  by the time I plugged in at around 9 p.m. I still had almost 50%.Now, if you're streaming youtube videos, etc., you can expect a more rapid drain, but the battery in this phone is as large as anything you'll find in any other phone on the market.The phone size is surprisingly sleek, with a screen almost a 1/2"" taller than my Moto Z4.  Android 12 presents a learning curve, having come from Android 10, but I'm getting used to it and I'm sure in another week or so it will be second nature.  Motorola keeps its Android branch as close to stock as you can get.  The Moto gestures are a huge benefit that I've come to rely on over the years, so I'm glad I found a phone in the Moto line.I was skeptical about the whole stylus feature and, to be honest, I've not had the need to use it so far.  I've played with it and it's easy and intuitive to use.  I can foresee a time when I'll need to write a quick note, and this is ultimately better than searching for a pen and scrap of paper that you might wind up losing.  It's totally unobtrusive, but it's there if you need it and easily accessible.  I view this as more of an added feature that I'll be happy to have when needed, but out of the way.I like this phone so much I'm going to purchase another one for my wife. I've tried it with both T-Mobile and Verizon sim cards and the phone is right at home with either service.Motorola has hit the nail on the head for performance, features, and affordability.  I hope Motorola continues developing and producing phones like this.  I'll remain a loyal customer if they do, and will recommend this particular phone for anyone asking ""What is the best, affordable phone on the market.""!",A great phone at a great price!,2022-10-07,5.0,R1BPGGTT79YHW,john,16.0,"I so wanted to like this phone.  But there is something wrong with it.  I can not really tell if it is fully defective or just a super crappy phone.  This is my 4th Moto.  I buy them for the cost and because I do not want to deal with a lot of unremovable ""bloatware"" (I'm talking to you Samsung).  Every Moto Phone I have had except the E5 Play with removable battery has had battery problems. The Charging Tech is junk. The Batteries have all swelled up about 18 months.  My 7 year old LG... never a battery issue.  So let me tell you about the Pros of this Phone.  #1 There are not Pros  Cons - yep.  Plenty of cons.  It's too tall and narrow... it is very slippery and uncomfortable to hold.  The screen is mediocre.  And the haptics are ""off"".  I can be holding it and just barely shift position and the screen with jump back.  It feels way too sensitive.  Conversely my G7+ which this replaced because of the swelled battery does not have this problem.  It's not super comfortable but actually a lot better than this.  And the Screen appears sharper.  The signal reception on this phone is TERRIBLE!!!  I get -119db, but when I pop the sim into my 7 year old LG I get -85db.  It's a massive difference.  Lets talk 5G.  My 5G reception is aweful and seems to be even slower than the 4LTE.  And because of the poor signal the phone is constantly hopping one to the other.  And I can see no way to just pick one of them and hafe it stick.  The battery life seems okay.  I have not bothered to update to Android 12 because I am probably going to have to return this.  Again I am not sure if it is defective or just really this bad.  Its the worse Moto phone (and also the most expensive) that I have ever purchased.  The midrange Moto Cameras are all paper specs and no performance.  Again my 7 year old LG just blows this out of the water... the images are flat dull and boring in comarison. And the focus is slow.  I didn't really buy it for the camera and would probably never use it anyways.  But why these companies pushing these rediculous specs on paper when they are using sensors about the size of a pencil eraser?  And why do I need/want 4 cameras.  Just put one basic decent 12mega pixel camera on it and be done. At this price range the cameras are all crap so why put 4 crap lens on when 1 will suffice.  Oh and the stylus.  Yikes.  Not useful to me at all.  So I bought this as a G7+ replacement thinking it would be a bit better and a bit faster, but it's not better at all.  It's worse.  Moto is wasting so much energy making so many models all similar but just a little different.  They should just make a couple models and try to make them the best at each price point which brings up another issue.  Pricing is all over the place.  It can vary by $100 or more depending on which day it is and how the wind is blowing.  Hard to tell... so hard to tell which models are supposedly better just by price.  Too many models.  I guess if you like the Green Color then the case plastic is the best thing.  I should have a new sim soon from another company to test if the phone actually has any kind of reception improvement.  I am not keeping my fingers crossed. Will be monitoring closely so I can get this thing returned before I make a mistake and get stuck with this brick.  Ask me how I really feel?  Answer:  So disappointed.  No way this thing is worth $399.  Not even $199.  This is a $79 phone on it's best day.  But hey Moto does have decent version of Android.  Right?",Something is wrong with this Model,2022-11-17,1.0

Came from an S9,98.0,R3AVJLE86C1R92,M Mullins,153.0,"My last phone was a Samsung A10e, and anyone coming from a cheap A series phone can for sure tell you that this is a MAJOR upgrade. I got the 128gb S21 FE model and I only paid $590 USD for the black version, despite really really wanting the white version, yet that one was priced at $699 USD. Would I pay $699 for it? Probably not, but everyone has a different budget for everything!When I received the phone, it came in its regular factory box which is very thin, like I was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case, but nope! They've cut down on everything that they send you. It came with the phone, a manual in a tiny box, a sim card tool behind that box, and I believe short type c cable, I already have a charging cable so I didn't pay any attention to it. Not that big of a deal really, it just worried me for a second haha.Now I'm someone who worries about storage, and this phone does NOT come with a micro SD card slot (unlike the S20 FE), however I've not had any problems with my storage yet, I still have roughly 61GB out of the 128GB to go. The system itself is 22.5GB which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine, and then I play a lot of games so my apps take around 39GB. I don't take many photos either so I only have around 1GB used, but if you are someone who loves to take photos, I recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over, as spending $70-$130+ for just 128GB of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500GB on a standalone drive. It is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone, also adds 2GB of ram to it, giving it a speed boost, but I'm about to go over some things about the phone's speed.As for game wise, I play Genshin Impact, Colorful Stage/Project Sekai, Stardew Valley, Pokemon GO, and Fallout Shelter, and this thing runs them all like a BEAST. I wouldn't recommend getting the extra 2GB of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it. Anyone who's ever played Genshin Impact knows how heavy the game is, and it can run it at max settings just fine, the only problem, is that it gets INCREDIBLY hot. So hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5-15 minutes. This could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around $20-30. I do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so I do play extremely comfortably in low-medium settings as it still looks great! However if you're looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games (since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game, causing lag), I'll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an Iphone or a Oneplus since they do that well.The camera is good for me! I take photos of my dog and that's it. It also has a 30x zoom which is crazy. The front camera is really good and I sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it's super funny haha. The fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector. Fun fact I found: you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it'll unlock! So you don't even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button. I was never a fan of 120hz screens and I still am not, but it looks super smooth when I have it turned on. The AMOLED screen was a huge game changer for me, it's beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors. I know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device, but I honestly haven't had any problems whatsoever. Now I do keep medium power saving mode on as I just don't see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you're not using it. It lasts about a day and a half. I work 9-5 and I come home with 70% battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently. Now I will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only, but I experienced that issue with my last phone so there's a massive chance that's just my mobile data provider (which is US Cellular). By the way, this phone is unlocked, so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use. I also think it supports 2 sim cards? I'm not too sure as I'm not someone who would ever have to use it, but if you are, then that's a plus.Overall this phone is absolutely amazing and I 11/10 recommend it :)",Love love love! Best phone I've ever had! Came from an A series phone!,2022-08-17,5.0,R1WCMVKUN1X983,Shawn,664.0,"Edit (7/30/2023): This will be the last update I write about the S20 FE, as I plan on getting a new phone in the near future.After 3 years with this phone, I can't say my feelings have changed very much. The only reason I'm writing this is to warn anyone thinking about getting this as a budget phone at some point in the future. The glue holding the back panel has loosened to the point where it is lifting off the phone. There is no bulging battery, as far as I can tell. The cheap glue that they used to put the S20 FE together is just not holding together anymore. They tout having software/security updates for however many years, but what good is that if the phone falls apart before you get to that point?To anyone reading this in the future: no, this phone isn't worth $499 (the price amazon has it as I'm writing this) new in 2023. The chip is still okay and it has that precious SD slot that phone manufacturers don't want to include nowadays so people buy the expensive, higher storage models. If you really, really want one to use as a budget phone, look for a refurbished one. I've found ones being sold for under $150. Who knows? Maybe the phone refurbishers used better glue to put the phone back together.I haven't decided which phone to get next. All I know is that it won't be a Samsung.Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It's been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here's the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic ""angry Amazon customer 1-star"" review, but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.","Great phone, marred by some pretty big issues.",2020-11-18,3.0

No updates to Android. The Palm Phone is running Android 8.

But there's a catch, which is that Verizon, and only Verizon, SIM cards must be first initialized on a Verizon phone. That's not the phone's fault, it is a Verizon-specific annoyance and it will be true of any new Verizon SIM combined with any non-Verizon unlocked phone. To my knowledge no other carrier makes customers jump through such hoops.Forget the five star reviews that include (usually with exclamation points) words like Cute! or Pretty! or Head-turning Adorable! If you want this phone to work for you in any practical way, it must be plugged inside a Mophie Juice Pack. That changes the Palm from a useless novelty to a practical, and still by any measure extremely small, phone that with a few setting changes will do most anything a giant Samsung can (you weren't expecting to stream movies on this, right?). Double the battery = lasts all day, and a >little< bit bigger and especially thicker turns out to be a good thing when you see just how slippery and fall-prone the phone by itself is (but with or without the pack, it still fits easily into your jeans' change pocket). GET THE JUICE PACK!Initial confusion by the carousel home page was short-lived as you can easily move your most-used apps to the top and then it's just like any other phone. Uninstallable Google stuff and for me some unwanted Verizon apps cannot be moved to another screen, but they can be ""deleted"" which means they drop to the bottom of the carousel where you don't have to look at them. Bit frustrated by the single external button, not because I expect buttons all over my phone but because you can program it to do only one of three things (I choose volume level).Had a disastrous experience at first with a ""refurbished"" (actually brand-new but gray market locked Verizon) unit for half the price with a special ""non-removable"" (unless you are sufficiently motivated!) SIM door and a fatal bug that caused it to reboot whenever a call came in from, and only from, another Verizon mobile number. Returned that and popped for the extra cash to get the real, unlocked version and no more issues.Besides a short-life (or no-life without the Juice pack) battery and the lack of expandable memory, I am on a Tracfone (Verizon in disguise) plan with only 1GB of data a month. Between those three limitations I have become intimately familiar with all sorts of economizing settings in Android that frankly you should already be employing, but you can get away with wasteful behavior on a phone whose battery alone weighs as much as five Palms, contains a 512GB SD card, and is on an unlimited data plan. Be warned, with the Palm you will need to find and activate settings you may not have ever bothered with before like data saver, battery saver, and limiting what apps can download and sync in the background and on cell service. I learned the hard way you can overdo this when Google Maps and Android Auto stopped giving directions but I figured it out quickly enough (download your map on WiFi, turn off ""Unrestricted data usage"" in the app, but leave on ""Background data""). Of course the biggest saver of all was preventing What'sApp from automatically downloading every photo and video my family wants me to see!I have not used the much-touted ""Life Mode"" and IMHO it's a gimmick - you could just turn the phone off and accomplish the same thing.The screen really is a wonder. If you set objects to maximum size some things will run off the screen in certain apps, but set to Normal, everything displays just as it should. Great job with the scaling and the difference between Normal and Large is essentially imperceptible anyway.I can't bring myself to give the phone five stars because you have to buy the Juice Pack to make it usable. Maybe back when the Palm was first introduced as a phone companion, i.e. a more powerful alternative to a Fitbit, the battery might have been tolerable; but in the two years since it has been available they've decided to market it as a primary phone and they should have come out with a (slightly) thicker and (slightly) heavier battery to make that claim a practical reality. So three stars for the phone by itself, four stars for the phone with its Juice Pack. P.S. shop around for the Juice Pack, don't just automatically buy it from whatever storefront you buy the phone from. Hint, hint.A couple of final notes about the Juice Pack itself, since as of this writing I can't find anybody on Amazon selling it and therefore can't leave a standalone review: exactly what it does is maddeningly difficult to figure out, nowhere in the advertisements, the web site, not even the instructions (such as they are) do they ever say, here's what this thing does. So to clarify: your Palm phone slides inside of it. There's a button on the back; press it once and some lights tell you how much charge >the pack< has (not the phone). Hold the button down and it starts charging the phone and lights start flashing (they go out in a minute). Once the phone is fully charged, the Juice pack turns off. What this means and what they don't tell you is if your phone is 95% charged and you activate the Juice pack, it's not going to make your phone last any longer because in two minutes the phone will be topped off. It would have been fantastic if the pack kept monitoring or querying the phone and automatically added charge as needed (in fact I assumed that's how it worked when I bought it), but that's not how things are; perhaps there's a technical reason why that can't be done. So in reality you will wait until your phone is significantly drained, say below 50%, and then hold the button to start charging. You charge the duo by plugging a USB-C into the >Juice pack< (or placing it with the phone inside* onto a wireless charger, that works out really well BTW since the phone is physically smaller than a typical wireless charger so you don't have to fiddle with it to try to get it centered). The phone charges first, then the pack charges.*I don't know if the pack will charge wirelessly without a phone inside; it did not say one way or the other in the instructions and I haven't had a reason to try it out.Some reviewers of the Juice pack have complained that it interferes with reception; I haven't experimented enough to say for sure about the pack, but it is fair to say that the Palm phone inside its Juice pack has weaker reception than a larger cell phone, call it one bar off. I have lost signal driving through spots that I have reception on other phones; whether this is because of the Juice pack or because the Palm has a weaker antenna (or both) I can't say for sure, but if you live or work in an area with spotty reception, that could be something to consider.",Three stars or four? Depends on your Juice Pack!,2021-02-19,3.0

The suction cup has to be on a flat surface, and you have to press down around the edges, and then press down on the holder as you press the lever down.  Then it is very secure. Anywhere on glass will get a good vacuum. I left the mount on the dash for over a week, and adjusted it many times.  It stayed solid.  When I took it off there was some discoloration on the dash that wiped off with a damp cloth. I did not use the included adhesive backed disc.The vent mount is also very well designed and sturdy.

The Moto edge 2021 is on Android 12 like my stylus but my stylus had more features than this phone. This phone doesn't have Dolby Atmos. The Only difference is this phone is a little bit faster. So I will say this phone, the 2021 edge is a good deal at 230.00 dollars.  Ni way is it worth the 700.00 dollars it cost when it came out. My stylus 2022 4g had more customizing features....Update: 2714 fe0fAfter a few days I am definitely noticing the difference in speed. Screen might be a little better than the stylus 2022 4g. Screen specs are the same. Camera much better on the edge. I thought not having Dolby Atmos on the edge was going to be a let down but actually sounds better with same setup as I had on my stylus. This phone does get LDAC as long as your headphones are capable of LDAC. A letdown is that No type of Stylus pen will work on the edge. You have to move up to the Edge+  that's the only knock I have on it. I bought the Quick Charge 3.0 Fast wall charger power adapter for android which was suggested for this phone. 18W. When connected it shows up on my phone in a bubble as Turbo power charger and it is Fast. Very pleased with that. 15 bucks with 9 & 6 foot cord. I use my own but I checked the speed on those and not much drop-off. Anyways for 230.00 I feel I got a Great deal. I paid 350.00 for my stylus 2022 right when it came out.

Five stars!,22.0,R2V6WXEERXH9S,4.0,Unbeatable Rugged Flip for the Price,19.0,R2XZ3B38K86XLQ,5.0,indestructable,2.0,R3FPAYB9QNZ2AF,x x,10.0,"Frequencies: It has a lot of frequencies covering 2G, 3G, and 4G.  Also, since it came out in 2021 as 5G was advertising, it has all the 4G fixings that some cellular companies denied phones for not having even when they had 4G.  Additionally, it has a radio built with several country's radio frequencies as selections, meaning you could visit a lot of different countries and simply use the phone as a portable radio player without even connecting it to cellular service.  It's not a HAM radio, but for a phone, it's pretty nice.Hardware: The phone 'could' handle 3GB of RAM, but Google would not put Android 11 Go on any phone that had more than 2GB of RAM, so the CAT s22 has the cap of 2GB of RAM.  The storage included is 16 GB, while the hardware can handle 128 GB MicroSD card, preferably the SanDisk High Endurance memory as specifically noted in other CAT phone documentation I read.  When this 128 GB MicroSD card of SanDisk High Endurance memory is used, the choice to use it as an external memory source(not encrypted) or as part of the phone memory(safer because it is encrypted) becomes a choice of yours.  Most apps and games and games will not run on the MicroSD card, but some will.  The app game works like this, install the app, login, download whatever you use, then close the app, move it to storage and see if it keeps working(Do NOT do this to apps you need, like your Firewall).  If it stops working when you try to run it, or when you try to run it after a restart, then it needs internal memory.Bloatware: This phone has bloatware, but not the sort that eats all your storage space, rather the sort that has no battery optimization options.  There were 20 apps on my CAT s22 with no battery optimization options after all updates.  The easiest solution is a Firewall, such Glasswire, or InviZible.  Limit the apps that are allowed to communicate and your battery will be a LOT happier.  There is no need to change permissions.  You can choose what talks using the Firewall.Keyboard: A lot of wimpering has been made on this keyboard.  The screen is fully touchscreen, and so that while the Kika(the physical keypad) and the Gboard are installed, the Gboard is set as default.  Simply set the Kika as the default keypad, and then go into settings and turn off the soft keypad display.  You'll find the Kika keyboard is very space efficient, definitely has a dictionary built in to guess words you haven't finished typing, and doesn't like spaces.  Wait, what?  My Japanese dictionary said Kika was a sunflower(rare)... so... that makes as much sense as anything else.  Japanese doesn't use spaces, it uses particles where spaces are.  That is to say, if you press the space button, the Kika's guesses clear, and it starts over.  However, space-less sentences the Kika is very good at.  Or, if you happen to be going for minimalism, and figure if you know enough words, one word should always do, the Kika has got you covered.  What about the choices in the Google Play Store?  There are three T9 keyboards in the Google Play store.  One is from France, one is from England(Tappy), and one is from India.  The most glitchy option is the one everyone recommends(Old T9), primarily because it works with the physical keyboard.  Each of the T9 keyboards has a different set of language options, though I find Tappy's option including the gaelics Irish, Scots Gaelic, and Welsh, as well as other languages, the most interesting.  Japanese is available from the T9 keypad from France, but it seems to me that Tappy is the T9 option most cared for by the developer.  That said, Tappy doesn't appear to work with the physical keypad, or if it does, I don't know how to do it, so Kika will do - because it is not glitchy like Old T9 is.  Also, dice passwords from dmuth would be ideal using the Kika keyboard with something like KeePassDX + Donate.  You could easily use it for a password chain of 8 words without spaces insanely fast with the Kika keyboard.  That is, your KeePass password database could feasibly be safer because of the Kika keyboard than on your laptop.Compatibility: Most everything runs on this... save a few oddities... like Bible Apps?  I mean, just for the craziest test, I installed the MMORPG Elemental Knights R Platinum, logged in(after I finally figured out how to make an account so it worked other place besides one phone - hint, the real username that is not shown is a random hexadecimal combination) and after I moved it to internal memory, it worked.  Here I am, on a 2.8 inch touch screen, logging into an MMORPG successfully.  Then OliveTree Bible doesn't work.  Explain that to me?  If you have this phone and want to memorize scripture from the Holman CSB, then the Audio Christian Standard Bible, The Bible Memory App(You might prefer Fighter Verses to this one), and Bible Memory: VerseLocker would be a good trio of apps to own.  eSword: Bible Study to Go and ESV Bible work well on the CAT s22 also.  Especially with the 128 GB MicroSD SanDisk High Endurance, the need for space for CDs you imported from the laptop is ever present.  Use Neutron Player and you can play .flac audio files on the CAT s22.Battery:  The battery is not much smaller than the screen size, which is what you want today's smartphone battery to be, the size of the screen.  Bluetooth is probably going to eat battery... certainly wouldn't be the first phone to do that to.  An unfirewalled phone will eat some battery, so the efforts to get your firewall down as tight as you can comfortably run it is worth it for the life of your battery.  Battery saver should probably always be on, and some apps use more battery playing voice or music than others.  The ESV Bible app, when playing voice, eats battery.  Still, that Kristyn has one of the most amazing voices I've never paid for.  It's definitely one of the best voices I've ever heard, easily the quality of the best voices I have paid for.  The battery is user replaceable.Security: I run DNScrypt 24/7.  The website and everyone else can know I'm coming when I get there, I don't need a sign on my back while traveling.  It's a phone, though, they aren't high security.  The apple phone that had a fingerprint hacked was by someone who looked at pictures of the person on the internet who owned the phone until he found one that included a good picture of their finger.  Ecryption is always CBC on storage.  I mean, sure, you can set the memory card as part of the phone memory, run DNScrypt, get the firewall tighter - by maybe starting with limiting system apps that anti spy mobile pro flags, tighten your web browsers down a bit, use SilentNotes, and use Threema to talk to family... but the rest of the advertising is smoke and mirrors.Annoyances:  The throttling sometimes causes issues.  Particularly if I am putting it through it's paces because it's a new phone to me and I want everything installed, logged in, and working by the weekend.  I went from an 8core with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB RAM for app storage to this CAT s22, a 4core with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB RAM for most app storage.  It's a little different, but there is something nice about a flip phone.  Now if I can just convince Kika that spaces are Kika's friends.Camera:  The display is 4:3 (480p, 640Hx480W), front & rear have 640x480 4:3 options(ratio=ratio, so proper display), however front & rear also have 16:9 higher resolution options marked as 4:3 options.  It may be an image edit(app or desktop) away from a presentable picture, or simply mistaken notes.  This wouldn't be the first 'oops' where ratio was mistakenly recorded wrongly giving mysteriously weird pictures that are only a simple fix away.NFC: there is no tap the phone to pay option on this phone - as my prior phone had this, which was a feature that was as unnerving as it was convenientApp Default Screen Limits: 6 apps on screen, 4 apps on quick app barApps that have worked for me:  ibisPaint, Stop Motion Studio PRO, Space Weather, Facts, Concise ISL(the screen never needs to be touched for this one - the thoughtfulness of testing that went into this app is easy to see when it works so nicely with the number keypad - the speaker button shifts the location the arrow buttons control from), Fighter Verses, Visible Body Physiology & Pathology, Audio Christian Standard Bible, Threema(chat works fine - i am having some odd issue with pics I upload into chat displaying, but it might be a setting I have wrong), Asahi Kanji, Ap Beibl, Anti Spy Mobile Pro, AIDA64, Audible, Microsoft Authenticator, Avery Cat, Bandcamp, Beginner's Go, Bioball, Biobla, Braille Tutor, Brightwheel, Caoga Caoga, Caustic 3, Privacy Cell, Crunchyroll, Crypto-Encryption Tools, Cwrs Mynediad, Cwrs Sylfaen, Docs To Go, e-Sword, Easy Thai Read, Elemental Knights Online Platinum, ESV Bible, Exploding Kittens, FreeBSD Doc, FreeBSD Handbook, HamStudy, HP Prime Pro(seriously, the keys are too small on this one, this is for a seven year old's enjoyment), iBless Torah, Judo Reference (Paid), Collins Irish Dictionary, JA Audiobook Learn Japanese, Kanji Quest, Kanji Tree, 'Kanji, Kana' (Readings of Chinese Characters... 300MB), KeePassDX, KeePro Unlocker, Kobo Books, Lamh Time, Learn CSS - Pro, Learn HTML - Pro, Learn Javascript - Pro, Level 22, Morse Code Practice Oscillator, Morse Trainer, Nemo Irish, Nemo Japanese, Neutron Player, Photo Editor (dev.macgyver), PlayerPro Music Player (Pro) (this plays videos you import), Pixiv Sketch, Pocket Mathematics, Pocket Physics, Posing App, Prime Video, Reddit, Remind, RPG Scribe, RPG Simple Dice PLUS, Ships Lights(well, the whole collection - there's 3), Kanazawa Shogi 2, SilentNotes, Sketch a Day, Skype, Survival Manual, Taekwondo Forms, The Chess - Crazy Bishop, Turnlehrer @home | gymnastics , Tumblr, Uciana(Kittens Game too), Bible Memory: VerseLocker, VRM Posing Mobile, WhatsApp, WHRMeter, Winzip, Word Games PRO (100+ games in one app), Yahoo Mail Go,  30b6 3000 82b1 672d,  30e9 30b8 30aaFM 65e5 672cPractical Memory: Stay around 14GB of the 16GB for performance reasons - You'll have to decide what apps are important.  If you have the ability to buy the 128 GB SanDisk High Endurance card should you decide to buy this phone, then you should consider getting it.  It can make a difference when you can transfer music from your computer, or photos, or videos, etc at your convenience.Update: On the Play Store, it has 12GB of app space available.  At some point, on my first run through on this phone, around 9 1/2 GB , the phone freaked and deleted my downloaded audio books(large files not required to run apps) from Audible and Kobo, and I couldn't download the audio books again.  I reset the phone, formatted the memory card as a normal storage card that can be used anywhere, kept a watch on Google Play, downloaded the wonder app SD Maid and SD Maid Key and obliterated that mess, then keep periodic watch so installed with audiobooks stays in 8.5 ish range.  No problems since.Perfect apps:  Concise ISL (Irish Sign Language), Magi Ann series (Learn Welsh) run exceptionally well and the physical keyboard can be used to navigate most or all of these app.  Easy Thai Read is another one... I didn't test it out much, but how well and cleanly it displays and scrolls is great.  Braille Tutor, uTalk, eSword, all look fantastic and perform very nicely.Note:  running i2p purple along with dnscrypt breaks Tumblr.  dnscrypt alone does not.",An Overview of the CAT s22,2023-09-09,5.0,R1A10I7HENJJ7T,Chris Ford,65.0,"I just want to make it clear that I purchased this phone because I've become completely disenchanted with modern technology, most notably humanity's inability to take their faces out of their phones, including my own. I see smartphone addiction as a cancer upon the human condition and am actively seeking phones that allow for a healthier lifestyle. Phones that serve the most basic functions of a phone with as little to no distractions as possible. Trust me, I'm not the only one. There is a rapidly growing want among people for simplicity, for all the noise to leave their daily lives. We're tired of being fed a constant stream of garbage through our devices and want to only be reachable by those who we know and love or those we work with.Let's start with the things I don't like. First of all, this thing is bulky. It very much reminds me of an old school RAZR V3 from the overall shape of the phone and the keyboard is also reminiscent. However, it's about twice as thick, if not thicker, than the Razr. Surprisingly for me, that's been more noticeable in the hand than in the pocket, and I don't mind a thicker phone to hold. I'm sure someone with smaller hands than a 6 foot tall American man would completely disagree. Would I like the phone to be closer in size to the Razr? Absolutely. Making this thing thinner would be most welcomed.CAT, you all need to thin this baby down!Secondly, let's talk about the PTT button on the side. This button is probably the number one or two worst part about this phone. Unless you have a buddy with the same phone, running the same PTT app, this button is just about worthless. If not using a PTT app, it's only good for one thing and that's assigning apps to the button for quick launch for either two clicks of the button or one long press of the button. However, if you're like me and purchasing this thing to abandon smartphones and the always online lifestyle cold turkey and forever, the button is absolutely worthless. I shouldn't say absolutely worthless, as it will be in your way for every phone call and you will hate the way it takes up hand grip room on the phone, as I do. My message to CAT would be either abandon this design idea or make two variations of this phone, one for construction and one for civilians.CAT, either get rid of the PTT button or make two versions of this phone.Second to last, it has too many smart features for my purposes. As I mentioned in the opening, I want a phone. I want it to call, to text, and to hold a charge for a week plus. That's it. I don't want a constant internet connection, no endless apps and scrolling, no games, no Facebook, no Google, I want to call and text. This phone is essentially a smartphone that folds. No kidding whatsoever. Just about every app you can imagine, you can download on this phone. The good news is you can either delete or disable every single app on the phone, which is a HUGE deal for people like me, as this ability is rare. Usually, if you buy a phone cluttered with worthless apps like Twitter, Facebook, and Google, you can't get rid of them. You can here! Albeit it's an android and Google you can't get rid of, but you can disable every Google related app that won't crash you operating system, which is good. However, I still don't even want that much connectivity. In my perfect world, my phone can call, text, and maybe have Bluetooth for hands free calling. I literally want nothing else. To even purchase a phone with smart features makes me feel dirty at this point.CAT, are you listening!?!?Finally, there's the texting. Just MY GOD. You have two jobs as a modern phone, to call and to text. Everything else are add-ons. This phone has fantastic call quality, make no mistake. But the texting... Eh. Let me just describe a senario for you. You try to respond to a text from a loved one. You pull it up, read it, click in the message box to reply and start typing. WAIT! There's just a jumbled mess where you message should be. Oh, I'm supposed to use the virtual keyboard? I don't like that can I switch to basic Abc texting or T9? Yes, you can, if you go into the settings and change your keyboard from the onscreen one to one called Kika preinstalled on the phone. Now, when you go to create your response, the keyboard will default to a backwards-ass version of T9, which I never cared for myself, but it may be your favorite. Who knows. But I prefer Abc because I learned to do it the long way and I'm incredibly fast & accurate at it, even today. Kika can change to Abc texting if you push the pound button, it will switch between T9, Abc, and abc texting. However, and this is a big however, Kika will default right back to T9 after EACH message, making you come back and push pound over and over and over again. As far as I can tell there's no default you can set for this and it's endlessly annoying. Now, if you prefer the onscreen keyboard or T9, no problem for you. But it's a small problem, that's been big for me and I'm sure others as well.CAT, you've got two jobs: call and text. Do it right.The biggest complaints from other reviewers were battery life, size, and a few others complained about the expandable memory. First of all, I've made my battery experience clear. The battery life is great if you turn off the crap and use it as a phone for calling and texting. If someone is complaining about the battery, I assume they are using this thing like a smartphone. Secondly, it's size won't change. It's thick when it's folded up but isn't bad really when opened. I do hope they make the next version thinner, however. Lastly, the expandable memory. I have no idea how well it works, as I've not tried installing more memory. The only reason I would expand would be for music, which I've just turned my old Samsung Note 20 into an mp3 player. So, I have zero use for expanding the memory.What do I love about it?Battery life. When you delete or disable every possible unnecessary app, turn off WiFi, bluetooth, and mobile data & simply use this thing as a phone, the battery life will last for days. I mean like the entire work week, not a day and a half. If you have even just mobile data on, the battery life is absolutely butchered down to a couple of days, maybe three. With WiFi and mobile data, your looking at smart phone battery life numbers. But I keep all the unnecessary off and I get a solid 5 days out of it, which is great.I love the grippy feel of the phone. It feels made to last and of high quality. The button layout is fantastic and like I mentioned, will remind you of the Razr V3. The buttons click hard and feel sturdy and tactile.All apps can either be deleted or disabled, which I already went over but worth reiterating.Call quality is fantastic. Probably louder and more clear than my old Samsung Note 20.Most importantly, this phone allows me to shut out the outside world, allowing only those I want to contact me to contact me. No constant news articles or advertisements or social agendas being force-fed and other bull nobody cares about.For those reasons alone it's worth the price and purchase. I wanted badly to give this phone at least 4 stars but can't in good conscience, as it doesn't deserve it. Almost but not quite.CAT, you guys are absolutely on the verge of having a true feature-less phone of the future. Fix what's wrong, stop catering to Google and top this beast! The next Cat Flip could be the best basic, feature-less phone on the market by cleaning up these small problems. I promise the want exists and is only growing!",Great Potential Squandered for Smart Features,2023-07-28,3.0

I got them on sale for $12, and am very satisfied with that (got Rosegold version). Tested on a call and they work great. Podcasts/spoken recordings are fine. Music is also fine for the price and ease of wearing. No complaints really. I actually like the control buttons on these better than my AirPods, which can sometimes get confused on skipping or stopping. There is an 'EQ' button which isn't top notch (don't hear that much difference between types), but is usable (goes through 6 music-type choices: Pop, Rock, Vocal, Jazz, Bass, Classic). A nice little added feature.Would I pay $25 for them? If I weren't watching every penny, yeah probably! They're just more comfortable than the pods in my ears all the time. (And they are sufficiently comfortable, too.) I'm trying to get back to listening to music instead YouTube podcasts all the time. LOL And these are definitely helping for that. They just feel like I should be listening to music with them, you know?I only started using them today, so no idea yet on battery life yet. But they did turn themselves off when I forgot to (leaving them unused for a while). So that's good. :)UPDATE: After several weeks of use, I can add a bit more: 1) The range on these are fantastic. I can leave my phone at one end of our house and walk to the other and suffer no degradation of signal at all. I sometimes forget where I left the phone! (Our house is a little under 1500 sq ft., so not a mansion, but my earbuds don't always reach that far.) 2) I have yet to find the end of a charge, so it does last a good long time. 3) Audio on the mic is fine; no problem using it on phone calls, as told to me by those I'm calling.

This is a budget device but it looks at least 3 times as expensive due to the premium looking materials used on the outside. You get a budget tier processor but it has ample true physical RAM at 8GB, expandable to 16GB using virtual swapping , but 8GB is quite ample and NOT budget tier, it's the same you get with the current Pixel 7.It came with a pre-installed tempered glass protector that I'd never be able to install perfectly myself so I'm glad they did it for me. It even came with a dark smoked TPU case which is a real bonus. USB-C to USB-C Charging cable and full power 20Watt (for this phone) brick. Modern equipment here.Everything works quick for normal usage tasks, like browsing the web, keeping up with your stocks, your social media, and all your messaging tasks. It doesn't skip a beat switching between apps due to the ample RAM.The default launcher it comes with is a bit limiting, like someone said they could only put 5 icons across. But I switched to another launcher and I'm able to place 6 across or more if I'd like, it's a limitation of the stock launcher. The screen is a 720P LCD.IMO, even todays budget spec processors are capable to handle basic browsing tasks with ease. If you actually do video editing or play graphics intensive games, then sure, you could benefit from spending more, but as a mature adult this does what I need quite efficiently.It even has the programmable button that the top tier maker is now promoting. Single, double, and long presses can be programmed to do what you want it to do. I wish ALL Androids have this built in.Battery at 5000mah is above average and can last me more than 3 days of normal usage.If there was a downside it would be the low light photography but it's still workable and daytime pics are crisp and clear.

If I put it in the other way and let go of the hook, the buttons will press against the inside of the cradle and turn up/down the volume.I guess if you are going to the gym and using their rowers, this is a compact solution to attach your smartphone, but for home use.

It also comes with a ""sticker""/base for dashboard mount but my dashboard is curved so I didn't try it (suction won't work as well on a curved surface). I cleaned the windshield area first with rubbing alcohol just in case.The suction cup has adhesive on the perimeter so it attaches really well. It's hard to then remove but is doable - I moved it twice (first time because I decided to go from horizontal to vertical orientation, and second to leave more space for the charging cable).It's fairly stable while driving and there is very minimal shaking (at least on paved roads, didn't try dirt or gravel). There is a ball joint on the back with nut to adjust the tension. It was easy to tighten it just right so I can adjust the tilt by hand without it being too loose and sagging by itself.The angle of the arm attaching to the suction cup can be adjusted to several positions - they ""click""/ratchet and can be tightened with a knob. That probably had to have several fixed positions so it won't sag, but it limits a bit possible positions. So I picked what I liked first and tightened it before installation to be sure it can sit just right.The telescoping arm can be extended several inches and there is another knob to tighten it - that works as expected.There is a ""lip"" on the bottom that holds the phone, and that can be pushed down by half an inch or so. Extend it fully before mounting (I first didn't do that and had to reposition); then you push it up if you need space for the charging cable. The ""lip"" has opening in the middle for charging cable (that's where my Android charges but don't know other devices).The phone locks with the two side ""wings"" which can be pressed/closed by hand. There is a button on the back to release them. That works well, the phone is held securely when driving, and is easy to remove.Overall quite nice and better than I expected.",Works well,2023-08-14,5.0,R2KUH34YDHG464,Amazon Customer,0.0,"I tried to attach to my dash, cleaned and the sticky base would not stick to dash.

The ""major"" updates Apple gave had been old features for Android. Recently, I fell in a rabbit hooe searching for Android gaming devices, and decided between this and the Samsung 23 Ultra.I got the 23 Ultra, and instantly fell in love, but the Red Magic 8 Pro was my first pick, as a gaming (emulation) was my priority, so I returned the 23 and grabbed the Translucent 8 Pro. While the 23 Ultra is the better feature rich phone, the 8 Pro is a gaming beast.First, I tested Genshin Impact, and while it performs better on iPhone 13 Pro Max (on Medium settings), this phone plays great with MAX setting when you set the in phone game mode settings to rise and the fan is blasting. To get great gameplay without compromising resolution and frame rate AND not having your phone turn into a piece of hot coal after 20 minutes is a absolut win for me. Mapping touch screen buttons to a controller definitely is a negative, as the performance is massively noticeable, compared to iOS native controller support, but that's a small price to pay for gaming freedom. I used the GameSir X2 (Bluetooth) for every phone.As mentioned earlier, my main reason for switching is freedom, and part of that is emulation without hacking (jailbreaking) my phone. I downloaded everything from NES to GameCube, GameBoy to 3ds, and this is where the Red Magic 8 Pro 16gb version outclasses the 23 Ultra. Right of the bat, every game I tested looked and performed better.With Mario 3D Land, the 23 Ultra played decently with 2x resolution  (""chugged"" here and there) while the Red had the same performance at 4x resolution on Rise mode. Dropped it to 3x and Balanced, and it played PERFECTLY. Visually, there is almost no difference in visuals between 3x and 4x on the phone, and was only able to tell them apart when I zoomed in on the screenshots I took to compare the different resolutions (from 2x to 4x).I won't explain every test I did (which took about 3 hours), but the one that impressed me most was God of War Ghost of Sparta. I was able to play that with 10x resolution on the 8 Pro on Balance mode with as if it was running at 1x resolution, while it became almost unplayable around 6x on the 23 ultra. Those gaming features truly make a difference.As for the other basic functions, some are serviceable, some are great. Calls on speaker are lower than when music plays. The music sounds great and loud to me (better than 13 Pro Max), but calls over the speaker sound like whisper in comparison. In a quiet room, any external noise would easily down out the call. Off of speaker, it sound loud and clear.Music is awesome. Streaming through Amazon Music (cuz the stupid app won't let me download and listen on another app, nor transfer out), the phone is surprisingly loud and clear. I didn't notice any distortion or unbalancing issues with the bass, and I definitely enjoyed listening through this phone than I did on the iPhone and Samsung. The fact that it has a headphone jack may not matter if you have Bluetooth headphones, but now you can tell people to ""pass the aux cord"" XD.The camera is surprisingly nice, considering it's primarily a gaming phone. The 13 Pro Max took some great pictures and videos, and the 23 Ultra blew that out of the water, but while the Red 8 Pro can't compete with them in a side by side comparison, they look great on their own. When you inevitably take a video or picture, you WILL be satisfied and impressed with how great they came out considering photography is not why you would consider this phone over something mainstream.Last, and certainly not least; this charges FAST AS HELL! In about 5 minutes, you'll gain about 20%. In about 30 minutes, you'll go from 2% to 90%. It doesn't matter how fast this phone dies (this WILL last you all day with moderate use) if you can charge it to 100% in such a short time. Unfortunately, it doesn't have wireless charging, but with charging speeds (65w) like this, I wouldn't use it, anyway.Tl;dr:If you want the best gaming experience on your primary phone, get the 16gb Red Magic 8 Pro.","Jack of all Trades, Master of Gaming",2023-05-16,5.0,R1M2V3GDRWV7KS,Hinkydoo,1.0,"It's an excellent phone.  Coming from iphone 12 pro max this phone is superior in every way.  I am on the t mobile network already so idk about the network compatability issues which others have spoken to.I am going to explain how you turn off RTT calling though, which will make this phone incrementally better for  you and the people you call.How to turn off RTT calling:Go to SettingsMobile NetworkChange network type to ""3G""Go into your dialerGo into settingsAccessabilitiesTurn off RTTReturn to phone settingsMobile networkTurn 5g back onDonePros: The screen is excellent, the CPU is excellent, the GPU is excellent, the refresh rate is excellent, the battery life is excellent, the charging speed is extremely fast, it's light weight, asthetically pleasing, the software is excellent and I have not seen any mandarin to English translation issues, customer service is prompt and thorough.Cons: There is a serious lack of accessories in the market for this device, finding a high quality case (ie OtterBox, Pelican, Mouse, etc) is impossible, finding a real leather case is impossible, not many Android OS updates will be made available, phone and accessories are priced much lower on manufacturer website (ie ""on sale"" here is MSRP w/o markup), requires some tweaking (RTT off) to actually be a functional phone for any sort of business calls, game controller accessory doesn't seem to fully function with mobile games (PUBG only one joystick is responsive) however this could be due to the fact that idk how to set it up yet, customer service is very opaque regarding any sort of future updates or cut off for software or security updates and I find conflicting information online but again may be my own mistake.Overall it's a very very high quality phone.  The performance is like nothing I have ever seen in a mobile device.  It technically has more ram at 22gb than my Acer Predator Helios 300 which has 16 gigs of ram and a 3070 Ti that Jarod labeled an ""S class"" laptop in 2022.  I feel like this is a much more appropriate phone to pair with that laptop, the iphone 12 always seemed like it was lacking by comparison.  If you have a gaming laptop I'd suggest this phone just for the fact that it will feel more like a seamless experience with the high refresh rate and benchmark scores when you switch from your laptop to your mobile device.  The issues with accessories are a big problem though, I would really like to have an ecco leather case or something more substantial like an OtterBox on a phone like this.  I found that the magsafe environment on the iphone was convenient, but I ultimately never used the wireless charging or the magsafe charger after the first year because they were so slow compared to the wired charger, and the redmagic wire charger blows that one away by comparison.  It's also worth noting that the heat difference between this and the iphone is unbelievable, that stupid iphone was always overheating, this redmagic phone doesn't even heat up while fast charging.  The integrated fan is a very welcome trade off instead of an IPXX rating as I rarely take my electronics into the pool and I do not make tik tok videos of my phone traveling through tunnels in canals.  It would be like if the predator laptop didn't have any fans and instead I could throw it into the pool and not have to use my brain for stupid things like consequences.  I guess a dust rating might be helpful though, especially since I can't take the phone apart like I can the laptop to CLEAN the fan so it's not a fair comparison.  I use all of these devices for work too and they are all perfectly suited to that environment.  The only thing lacking from a business / functionality standpoint is the lack of an integrated stylus, but idk where they would even put one in something which I imagine must be very compact internally.  However the ability to cast to my projector via the integrated widget is an excellent trade off and the ability to connect a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse as well as a monitor and Ethernet is just on a whole other level.  I haven't tried running MS suite on this yet but I'm not worried about it.  I don't see excel slowing this thing down with pivot tables, multiple tabs, or complex equations having to load.  I have not tried the mouse and keyboard yet but I am excited to in the future and with my projector as a screen.For accessories I would suggest a carbon fiber case and glass screen protector (because I can't find anything else), with a ram mount phone holder since this does not support wireless charging.  Give the lack of a good case on the market and the delicate nature of such a powerful phone you don't want to skimp on the car mount and end up with a broken phone.

Although it looks rough, the 2408x1080 resolution still gives you clear vedio quality and rich colors.  Even in the wild, you can still enjoy a perfect visual experience.  The most exciting part is that in addition to the regular 48MP rear camera and 16MP front-facing selfie camera, it is also equipped with a 20MP night vision camera and two infrared lights, which can take clear photos in dark environments at night.

This phone is built in its own protective case. You can't really get one for it anyway. You can buy a screen protector though and you should. Within 10 minutes of activating it, I dropped it gave down in my gravel driveway. Not a scratch on the case or screen. I have acquired two tiny scratches on the screen since, probably from my car keys in my purse with it, that's why I say still buy a screen protector.This phone is SO heavy and thick. It's like stacking 3 of my Galaxy S22's on top of each other. My kids nicknamed it ""Billy Brick"" because it is literally like holding a brick. I'm sure this is because of the massive battery and heavy case. It can get tiring holding this to talk or type. It is too thick to be held by a regular phone mount in your car or on a tripod. I don't know if you can even buy a mount deep enough to securely hold this phone.The battery is amazing. I went camping for 4 days and still had half a battery when I got home.The phone says its waterproof, like you can swim with it. I haven't tried that. I can say that the SIM/SD port is sealed on the inside with a silicone ring. The charge port is sealed with a rubber plug on the case.The camera is glitchy. It says it's taking a video, does the whole recording thing. Then when you end the recording, it just disappears. I am tech savvy, I'm not not using it properly or looking in the right location. It's like it has some software error. It only effects the video, not still photos, and it's intermittent, it only happens sometimes. Also, the zoom is jerky. It doesn't transition smoothly in the view finder or the finished video.The display is jerky when scrolling. Like when I'm scrolling Amazon products,they go out of focus and become grainy until the screen stops moving, then they focus again. Its not just Amazon, its any page you scroll, graphics and text.I want to love this phone, but I don't.

A. Mitchell,7.0,"The Umidigi A15C is a great inexpensive phone all things considered.I have had several Umidigi phones in the past and I can say from my experience they continue to improve and provide a good value for people looking for reasonable price vs performance phones. I purchased the space gray color and was it was received very quickly so Kudos for that.  The phone specs that I am usually concerned with are listed a bit later in the review if you want to see that level of details otherwise here is my impression of the phone.The phone is well packaged in a recycling conscious box which includes a gray tinted semi- transparent protective case for the phone, wall charger, charging cord, sim tool, and small paper manual covering the basics of the phone.  A plastic type screen protector is already on the phone screen so that helps a bit.The fingerprint reader is the right side power button and is easy to setup as well as fast to unlock phone unlike some of the in screen fingerprint readers of other phones.  Interestingly enough the phone can keep up with me when I am entering the 6 digit unlock pin number when required. (many other phones do not and I have to type in the pin number slowly for them to recognize all the numbers)  I don't turn on face unlock so I wont comment on that feature.I found the processor/CPU can keep up with my needs with no real lagging or pausing while using multiple apps and doing app updates.  Scrolling pages and other common browser tasks are fluid.  I don 2019t use my phone for games so that may be a different result.Screen is bright and clear, resolution is moderate and refresh is not noticeable so pretty nice for a lower cost phone.  Screen does get a bit overtaken in direct sunlight.The rear camera system is comprised of a 3 circle area that contains a 48Mp sensor binned down to 12Mp @ F1.8 for main camera, a 8MP Ultra-Wide Camera @ F/2.2, and a 5MP Macro Camera @ F/2.4.  Photos from the main camera, ultrawide and macro are as expected and are social media level of quality.The front selfie or video conferencing camera is a 8MP @ F/2.2 and seems to work well for Zoom calls.Wifi stays connected around the house and yard.Blue tooth connects to my speakers, headphones and car.AT&T cellular data and VoLTE calling is working provided by Red Pocket mvno sim. I did have to set the APN information for Red Pocket as usual.  It has been on Red Pocket ATT for about a week and its still calling out via VoLTE.  Phone does not seem to offer Voice calls over Wifi for Red Pocket.T-Mobile cellular data and VoLTE calling is working as provided by T-Mobile post paid sim. I did not have to set the APN information for T-Mobile.  Phone does offer Voice calls over Wifi for T-Mobile as the menu item is present and controllable when using the T-Mobile sim..Sound is very much a cell phone sound but the volume is good without heavy distortion.  Call volume for speaker phone and handheld calls is loud and clear enough for the normal environments I use a phone in. Still has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack.The specs are reasonable for the cost of the phone and include:Android 13 June security updates.  Umidigi has improved over time at providing security updates but don 2019t expect Android version updates and other improvements as they are typically not provided.8GB Ram with the option to increase the available memory by utilizing Rom storage space as operating memory.  I appreciate the option is available but find 8GB is perfectly acceptable for a daily use smart phone.128GB Storage memory for storage of apps, pictures and all sorts of other data.The 128GB of storage can be increased in size with the addition of a micro sd card if needed and I tried a 64GB SanDisk that worked easily.CPU is a Unisoc Tiger T606 which is an entry level octa core processor.6.7 201d HD+ Full View Display, Resolution: 1650  00d7 720, Aspect Ratio: 20.6:9,  Brightness: 500 nit (typ), and Contrast Ratio: 1500:1.

Problem is it freezes up with OEM email app, OEM texting app, and an installed forum app. Locking up has progressively gotten worse over the last few weeks. For example attempting to do the return through Amazon app I ended up staring at an all white screen for about a minute before I gave up, rebooted and tried again.Also if I'm running Spotify in the background or get a phone call, no apps want to work afterwards. Have to reboot, crazy!With these specs I can't believe it. I must have gotten a lemon or something I don't know. Can't recommend though either way.

This is a good product. It is well designed and sturdy.It 2019s not going to fall apart on you. You can pose your phone in multiple positions and it will not shift once placed. My iPhone 13 fits well on it and a larger phone would have no issues.It has a built in silicone pad to prevent the phone from moving when placed. It also seems to help with heat.There are also silicone grips for feet so it doesn 2019t slide on uneven or glass surfaces.They color matched the logo with the brass/gold in the green color which is a nice touch and an attention to detail often missed from others.Everything functions as designed and the seller was prompt in getting the item out and it was well packaged.I have one pro/con. It is a major one and that is the weight which affects its use as something travel friendly. It is quite heavy.I originally got this for dual purpose so I could use it around the house and when out and about as I 2019m disabled and often drop things/ knock things over due to my neurological issues.Trial and error (and numerous broken phones and other broken accessories) has led me to figure out portable stands work best for me personally.That way if I 2019m in the kitchen at a table, or at a restaurant, or at an doctors appointment I can just shove it on whatever flat surface is nearby and monkey around for a few, toss the stand in my walker basket when done and go; or have a phone stand for overnight charging when I go to bed or do virtual calls or general scrolling.This while a good stand is far too heavy for all of that.It has a weighted base to avoid tip over. They probably went a bit overboard on how much weight was necessary.While I can say it 2019s not going anywhere when the phones on it I can also say it 2019s not leaving the house. It 2019s just too heavy to keep in my purse or shove in my carryon.I handed it to my Mom for her assessment and she agreed on the weight being too heavy for travel. She did also like the stand in general and it even held her massively oversized overstuffed wallet case iPhone 13 without tipping.I think they could adjust the weight in the base slightly to make it lighter while still holding the same function. Right now this is advertised as a travel friendly stand and I would have to disagree with that statement.It is however a wonderful stand for your home office or next to your nightstand.Will keep, but knocking one star off for it not actually living up to the multipurpose travel friendly design description.Still using for home and don 2019t regret buying it.","Good, but heavy",2023-08-05,4.0,R3PFVN1ES4P672,Leigh,0.0,"Generally, a good phone stand however, I ordered two and both are the wrong color. When received, I placed the boxes aside and when I finally opened them, the return window had passed or I would ask for a replacement. The picture on the box shows the correct color but the products that arrived are black.Make sure you open the box to check what color received and pay attention to the return deadline if you get the wrong item.","Good stand, received wrong color x 2",2023-09-05,3.0

But here are the things that I've noticed:Issue number one, the charging cable USB C to USB C that came with it does not fit in the charging port on the bottom. You can't put it in all the way. :-( making it impossible to charge with the cable that came with it, I tried other cables that I have and you kind of like have to jam it in there because of the outside of the port it's got that cover that make it hard to put the cable in.Issue number two, it's impossible to take halfway decent pictures with it as it the flash is not bright enough. When you take the picture and try to view it it goes really dark and it stays dark. No matter what I can do I can't figure out how to keep the pictures bright. I was hoping it would take good pictures seems the quality of the camera. But it does not. Unless you re-edit the pictures and make them brighter after which defeats the purpose of having a good camera to take pictures without having to edit them. My old Samsung does better even at lower megapixels.Issue number 3, it doesn't seem to be using standard Google keyboard for doing the text as you have to hit different buttons just to get into different modes whereas the old Google keyboards on the Samsung phones seems to be all right there in one place. Making the tank hard to text.Issue number four, using two SIM cards doesn't really help because I can't access the second SIM card. It seems to always go to the first one and that's it. Which kind of defeats the purpose of having two SIM cards.There's a lot of other issues, that I've come across. But one thing I don't understand is that it only gave me 30 days to test this and then I can't send it back because the return is expired after 30 days. When testing a phone for one month of service you should get a bit more time before the return date expires. How can you test a phone monthly service if you only get a month to test it and you can't return it after the month if it doesn't work out? So after 30 days of testing this thing out giving it time for one month of using the SIM card now I can't return it. So now I'm stuck with a $300 flashlight as that's the only thing that seems to be any good in this phone.",So many issues for what is supposed to be a good phone. :-(,2023-09-13,1.0

A few additional apps offered during setup from both TracFone and Google Play Store per usual but keep in mind some random games and social apps like TikTok and SnapChat will randomly install itself after you connect it to Wi-Fi during the setup process even after the setup is complete which takes up a whole gigabyte of storage but you can uninstall these apps right afterward (Facebook is pre-installed into the system so you can only disable that). However keep in mind right afterward you finish the setup of the device, update it to android 12 before putting any data on it because it might get stuck and you'd have to factory reset it to do the setup all over again, after that everything is good just do the setup again and remove the apps that install themselves and you're good to go. Another downside is that some notable standard features such as sound customizations like amplifier and equalizer are missing from the settings as well as screen recorder/screenshot tools are also missing from the quick panel even though those are also supposed to come standard with all One UI devices. I can't seem to find Good Lock in the Galaxy Store and Sound Assistant doesn't work right without the sound equalizer feature. I understand it has no Bixby features since this is a budget device and not a regular mid range A series or flagship, but some of the essentials I like using on my other One UI devices aren't there or are supported. However in the end this device has amazing hardware for the cheap price and the functionality can really be amazing for what you'll get out of a budget phone. -Kai Edward Bannon, Android technology expert","Great cheap phone, but be careful when upgrading to android 12, battery can last all week.",2022-12-27,4.0,RWDLO9U84QVNS,foobarproof,1.0,"this would be a good phone if it were possible to disable or uninstal OneUI, but alas, it is not possible to avoid OneUI so the phone is quite slow as shipped. it got to decent by doing the following: install apps, including gboard, choose browser, and the standard google apps for contacts phone and messages. also disable battery use, notifications and data use wherever possible for all the samsung apps and wherever possible disable or uninstall samsung apps.",good hardware hobbled by OneUI but.....,2023-08-10,3.0

So far I am overall happy with this unit. The screen quality is very good for a lower to mid budget laptop and colors are vibrant enough. Touchscreen works great as well. I like the idea of the flexibility of changing between laptop mode and tablet mode. The 16"" screen size in tablet mode is great for watching movies and other random entertaining things, but if your goal is to use it for note taking or similar, it is a little on the larger side and would recommend the 14"" instead.  My main purpose is to use it for travels and remote work via remote desktop, so the additional real estate on the screen was important for me for my engineering work (CAD and programming).Since I also have a need for multiple monitors when stationary, I went ahead and also purchased a cheap off-brand USB-C docking station from Falwedi on Amazon. I was able to expand to at least 2 additional monitors, resulting in a triple monitor setup, one 24"" Dell 1080 and another 27"" Dell 2K. I did however get some issues where the external monitors would blank for a second or two occasionally, but not yet sure if this was due to the current drivers on the Ideapad or the off-brand docking station. Something I will need to investigate further at a later time.Sound quality from the speakers is just ok. There is no base, which I wouldn't expect from a lower budget laptop anyways. The camera worked decently and clear, which is sufficient for most video conferences anyways.The fingerprint reader works flawlessly and makes login into Windows and other biometric supporting apps super easy.I am however surprised on how heavy this unit is for being a new modern 16"" model. Reminds me of my 10+ year old Toshiba brick. Another drawback is that the pen or stylus was not included with it and is sold separately.There is no ethernet port and for those that want to utilize wired connections, will need to purchase an additional dongle.",Little on the heavy side but good otherwise,2023-07-21,4.0,R26JLCYDB9ADUG,Glen Jones,12.0,"So the computer itself looks nice.

Although the product has some positive aspects, there are areas that require attention for a more satisfying user experience.CPU Performance and Chrome Usage:One significant concern is the laptop's CPU usage when running resource-intensive tasks, such as opening/closing applications and heavily utilizing Chrome browser. As a power user who frequently works with multiple Chrome windows open simultaneously, I noticed that the CPU operates at 100% capacity, leading to potential performance bottlenecks. For users with less demanding tasks, this may not be a problem, but if you require better CPU performance for your tasks, you might want to consider other options.Mousepad Sensitivity:Another minor issue I encountered is the mousepad sensitivity when holding the laptop with one hand. The mousepad tends to get stuck, which appears to be related to the material and design of the laptop. While not a critical flaw, it's worth noting for potential buyers who value solid construction.Positive Aspects:Aside from the mentioned issues, there are several positive aspects to this laptop that I appreciate. It boasts a sleek design and appears to be well-built, except for the mousepad issue. Additionally, its overall performance is adequate for typical daily tasks, and the screen resolution provides a clear and vibrant display.",Ok for small work,2023-08-04,4.0,R28DOAK7I2DA58,Anna,0.0,Battery life is short and I don 2019t like the graphics on this laptop.,Not so good,2023-09-02,3.0

I was looking for a replacement for a three year old model. A brand new version of what I got retails for around $1100. This refurbished unit was in perfect condition. It was supposed to have a fingerprint reader but I contacted the vendor and discovered that they had been misinformed. They rapidly rectified the issue in days with just a couple emails.The computer itself was clean, the display is delightfully clear and bright. The AMD Ryzen CPU is more than twice as fast as the machine it replaces. It has run everything I need with plenty of headroom (typically running less than 6% CPU. The NvME SSD is blazing fast.) The 16 gigabytes of RAM is provided by two SoDIMM which allows dual-channel, interleaved access making it even a little faster. I've used it on an external monitor and gotten great 4K results at 60 Hertz. This was a great bargain. Plus, the vendor support was excellent.I want to call out the specs on this again. AMD has an excellent line of CPUs and are comparable to Intel's latest generation. The construction of the ProBook follows the same frame design as the EliteBook which is the top of the line business machine, with fewer ports. It would be hard to match this for anywhere near this price. I've used other Amazon refurb products and been pleased at the value.

I had been wanting to get a laptop that had a dedicated graphics card, a backlit keyboard, good system specs, upgradeability, at a good price.Throw in the fact that Asus includes one year of ACCIDENT PROTECTION, and this is a winner!!  While only having this laptop for a couple of days (Edit: Weeks now) now, I am so far, not disappointed with the purchase.  Here are my initial impressions, the pros and the cons.  Pros:  Audio:  The onboard speakers are quite adequate.  While not some of the ""loudest"" they are more than needed for watching youtube, hearing system alerts, recreational music,  video calls, stuff like that.  I have not yet tried the speakers while gaming.  [Edit] Ok these speakers are definitely high volume.  Watching youtube, I have the speakers at 50% and the audio of the video at 5% !  And I'm worried that the people across the hall might be kept awake while I insomnia the night away.  Also for the fact that these are laptop speakers, the quality is REALLY good.  I've been listening to MP3s on this machine and its been quite satisfactory.  I had a soundbar on my older ""gaming"" laptop, because the speakers were crap.  Definitely not the case here.  The screen:  The screen is very good resolution, quite bright, and very comfortable to read on.  Whether in regular daylight, a lit room, or in the dark.  I have not yet tested it as far as gaming.  CON:  This screen is SMALL.  Coming from laptops with 17.3"" screens, this is quite an adjustment.  The screen does have very small, thin bezels, so it does a good job giving you the most screen for footprint.  However, as somebody who does a lot of video and text editing, this is not what I would really want.  If I were working with 3d models, I would definitely want an external monitor or two.  It also does NOT fold flat.  This is no problem at all for me.  But for those that are looking for a device that will do so, this is not it.  [Edit]  Finding the settings to adjust saturation, color balance, stuff like that, I can't find it!  And when I'm editing images, this screen has a very high yellow saturation.  So unless I can find, or download something that will let me see colors the way their meant to be, and external monitor is going to another costly expenditure. (Edit: After a lot of web searching, I've fixed the problem with too much yellow saturation.  It's a windows 11 problem, not the machine.  Poorly implemented color scheme files by Microsoft in the windows 11)  Build Quality.  So far, this machine is quite sturdy.  The materials are good, and it doesn't feel like I am going to break it.  Or worry about having problems with it in my backpack.  Everything fits together very nicely.  Also when removing the bottom shell to get into the guts of the machine, I didn't feel like I was going to break it, or anything else, while using the spreader to pop the clips apart.  I do recommend the proper tool for the job tho.  Don't just try to jerk it apart after taking all those screws out.  Keyboard:  As with any new laptop, getting used to the key layout is almost always a chore.  There is no unified layout for the specialty keys.  For just typing, the layout is REALLY good.  The keys are spaced together Just Right, and doesn't cause me to make as many typos as my larger machines, where the keys are spaced further apart.  They are very tactile, and make very little noise.  They don't have the feel of mechanical keyswitches.  They may be membrane keys, or a combination.  [Edit]  Membrane keys.  I would rather have switches personally, as it's less to replace, if one key, or a couple of keys fail.  But they work really well in this machine.Other than when I have the machine sitting awkwardly on my lap, I have absolute NO problems typing on this, and can hit the keys that I'm aiming for quite intuitively, with very little in the way or typos induced by the machine.  The backlighting is GREAT.  I can very clearly see and read the keys in low, and no light.  I do wish that they could use combined colors, so that I could set one part of the keyboard to one color, and a different part to a different color.  Which really assists in gaming, using keyboard shortcuts.  But for me, that's not a dealbreaker.  I can read them in the dark, and that is what I was wanting.  The layout for the specialty keys is ""Fairly"" standard.  Tho the sleep mode key being on F11 and especially the airplane mode being on F12 is something that is not a wise choice as those are pretty common shortkeys for quite a few programs.  Mouse:  The mouse functioned quite well, right out of the box.  I do wish that it was set a bit further to the left, in an offset style.  As the butts of my thumbs do pass across the pad.  But for a laptop this size, you get what you get.  The cursor sweeps across the screen quite well, with minimal effort, right out of the box.  Big plus.  It also uses hardwared mouse buttons.  Not corner clicks on the mousepad.  Honestly, thats a HUGE win, IMO.  The corner click system I've never really liked, its an area that collects dust and crud, and has to be cleaned.  Whether this suits you or not, well, that's individual taste ;)CON: This mousepad collects oil.  It collects oil REALLY bad.  Weight:  This machine is VERY PORTABLE.  The weight is quite light.  I was actually very surprised when I opened the box.  I almost wondered if there was something missing.  Between the machine itself, and the power brick, this is QUITE light.  My Sager laptop is a brick.  The powerbrick is huge and weighs a ton.  This machine is most definitely a very welcomed upgrade from that!  Noise:  This machine really surprised me as far as the (lack of) noise from the fans.  I have had cooling pads with fans in them that have made more noise than the cooling system in  this machine!  ASUS has really outdone themselves with the cooling system.  Tho as stated, I haven't tried gaming on this thing yet.  But so far, the noise level from this is  quite pleasant, and very unobtrusive.  [Edit] Ok, so the fans have kicked on.  They are no means loud, compared to some of the other laptops that I have owned.  It's actually pretty subdued, for laptop fans.Somebody else had mentioned that they sound kind of like airplane turbines.  Yeah!  They actually kind of do! :D  Which is cool!  But again, they're fairly quiet.  I seriously doubt that they would bother anybody except for maybe a fairly light sleeper.  Heat:  Again, a very pleasant surprise!  I've run this machine a straight, solid 24 hours, and have not had the fans kick on high.  There is no hot air blowing out of the side ports, and it's extrememly comfortable on the lap.  (One of my HP laptops has literally left bald spots on my legs from the heat!)  Upgrades:  There are two slots for RAM.  Which are the standard open the clips, slide the new one in/out variety.  This makes upgrading the RAM very simple.  There are two slots for m2 type Solid State boards, which are spaced widely apart.  This is not only making it very easy for install/removal, but also for heat control.  Next to the battery, (NOT removable!) [Edit]  (The battery IS removable.  Just not externally like older laptops.  You have to open it up, disconnect it, and then it can be removed/swapped. )  There is a connector for a 2.5"" SATA drive.  Which included connectors.  I myself don't like the idea of putting a drive that close to the battery.  But considering how little this machine is, and how little space there is inside... it has to go somewhere, right?  And at least, we can add a 3rd drive!  Boot up:  With the operating system installed on a SSD, this machine boots up really fast.  Granted windows will really slow it down when it decides to do a mandatory update.  But without those, I press the power up button and within seconds, I'm typing in my password.  Very nice!  Edit 3/25/23:  After installing 32gb of ram, the first boot up was a tad slow as the BIOS updated to the new system specs.  However.  After that.  Oh lord!  I hit the power button and I could log into the machine almost instantly.  Speed:  So far the processor/RAM/SSD combination is a winner.  Even Adobe Photoshop CS6 fires right up.  Haven't tried it with gaming so far, but so far, my intensive programs aren't suffering any kind of slow-down, stuttering, or lag.  The exception to this is my browser.  I run A LOT OF TABS when I am surfing.  And browsers are heavy RAM hogs.  Yeah, one of my browsers is getting a lot of hesitation.  But that will go away when I upgrade RAM.  Edit 3/25/23:  I've just installed 32gb of T-Force Zeus DDR4  3200 CL-22 Memory to the machine.  It was super easy as far as the computer was concerned.  The packaging for the memory gave me more trouble than putting it into the laptop, LOL.  But then, I'm also a computer technician, so your mileage may very depending on your experience level.  The machine now boots up at 9% memory usage.  The clockspeed is reporting at 2933.  This is not a defect in the laptop.  This is the BIOS not automatically being set to run memory at higher speeds.  You can look up the instructions of how to do this online.  It takes a few minutes.  But do so on another machine, as you will need to be able to read the instructions while this laptop boots up.  Look up ""How to enable XMP to run your RAM at full speed"".CONS  Size:  As I said before, this is a very small, portable machine.  In that aspect it is fantastic!  However.  The palm rest is small enough that if you use an external mouse  there is VERY little room on the palmrest to put a mouse on it, much less use it.  I am constantly running the mouse over the arrow keys and part of the numpad.  This has caused me problems as those keys interact with programs, when I don't want them to!  This for me, is a huge con, as I really do use a laptop ON my LAP.  The screen is also small.  While I don't have very good eyes anymore, it's clear and easy to read.  But for some of the applications that I use my machines for, a larger, external monitor is going to be a must.  Windows 11:  This is a personal choice.  I myself believe that Microsoft went in a very, very bad direction with the latest release of their OS.  I will be backtracking the Operating System on this machine backwards to Windows 10 at the very first opportunity.  [Edit]  I really do hate this operating system.  The look of it is similar, but much different in ways that I don't like.  I also do not like the way that MS did the new taskbar.  The right click context menus are also way, way different, and very much not to my liking. [Edit] I found how to revert the context menus, looking around on the web.Especially since the changes that they made to the right click context menus are NOT compatible with a lot of the software that I use.  Disassembly:  Ok.  This is a pro/con situation.  Taking this machine apart to get to the guts is actually really simple.  There are 11 screws holding the plate underneath to  the machine.  They are easy to take out, and the plate is fairly easy to remove.  HOWEVER.  These screws are all different lengths!  So you HAVE to keep track of which one goes where!  NON-Removable  External battery:  This is an obvious con.  Not only can you not carry around a spare, but you cannot easily replace the existing one, if it goes bad. [Edit] As I noted before, yeah the battery can be replaced, but you have to open up the lower shell.  It's not a hot swappable battery that we got used to on older machines.  RAM slots.  Ok, this was a huge let down for me.  I was planning to simply take out the RAM from the machine that died, and put it in here to upgrade the low 8gb of ram that  it comes with.  It doesn't FIT!!  The pin arrangement is different, and the slot in the board is spaced further to the left.  I will have to look up what RAM this thing takes and purchase new boards to perform the upgrade.HOWEVER.  And this... this is awesome.  There's only ONE 8gb stick in this machine, when it arrived.  NOT paired 2x 4gb sticks.  What that means is that I can just throw another 8gb stick in here, and double the memory.  Without having to sacrifice a stick that was already in it.  Because it wasn't already in it!  Or, I could just throw in a single 16gb stick and instantly TRIPLE the ram, at significantly less coss.  I'm reading conflicting information about how much this machine supports.  Most say it's 32gb, while some say 64gb.I am more inclined to believe 32, but I don't know for sure.  Expansion slots:  Pretty much all of the connectors for USB, Video Out, and audio are all on the left side.  This, since an external monitor is going to be a must, will cause  some arrangement problems.  It could cause problems for people that also will be using this on a desk.  One thing that I love about my older Dell laptops is that they have some  of the afore mentioned ports at the BACK of the machine.  Or at the Rear Corners.  More USB ports would also be a very nice addition.  No Optical Drive.  Maybe I'm just a dinosaur, but I do miss having an optical drive bay.  Being able to watch DVDs or burn disk was a habit from way back in the day.  Or just taking the tray out, and swapping in a 2.5 sata drive through an adapter was also a very seriously nice option.  Ahhhh, progress LOL.  8 Gb of ram:  This combined with Win11, the LOAD of software marked with ASUS, and that crapware McCaffee pre-installed...  the machine is running at around 50% memory usage.  The Asus Monitoring software, along with the bloated goat OS is taking up quite bit of the system memory.  After uninstalling worthless McCaffee, I've cut it down to about 40% with 8gb RAM.  And as stated above, this machine takes different RAM boards than those used by machines from a few years ago.  512 GB Solid State Storage:  Ok.  This is a pro/con situation.  512 is quite good, in comparison to what similar machines are offering, which is half that.  At the same  pricepoint as these machines.  And as mentioned above, the machine will support up to 1tb storage boards, or SATA drive.  So there is definitely room for expansion with this machine.  However, to do so, IS an added expense.  And if you are planning on adding on a lot of games to this, you are definitely going to want to expand on the storage capacity!  Fortunately, it does have a sata slot.  Which means that you can add in a 1tb sata drive for considerably less money.Overall, the only thing that I'm going to complain about, is the size of the palm rests.  It's very comfortable for typing on.  But, as most of the applications that I use, I need those concise, accurate mouse movements.  And not having room to use a mouse on this machine is going to be a problem.That, and having to purchase windows 10 and what I will have to go through reinstalling drivers.  But again, that's a personal choice.",A great portable machine for daily use.  Mediocre gaming machine.,2022-12-18,5.0,R31WZZJHAD6UJ6,RSP,3.0,"So until the 13th generation of Intel CPU, the I series CPUs supported both EFI and bios legacy OS installation and booting yet this laptop has had that option removed. There is also no way to disable TPM which means Windows 11 just gets to install itself whenever it wants and you don't get a choice unless you want to solo boot Linux. Oh and you wanted to do a uefi/legacy bios Windows Linux dual boot so that they don't cross contaminate? F*** you says Asus, because as I previously mentioned that's not an option because they removed it. Also if you bought this laptop because of its promises to be easy to upgrade, it wasn't offensively bad but it has no right marketing itself that way, it was still fairly annoying to get the back plate off. As another note they used multiple different sizes of screw to hold in the back plate and only one of them is captive... Dell latitude e6410 from 2011 had only three screws of the same size and one of them was captive. I won't ask to return it unless something seriously bad goes wrong but my first day impressions are pretty bad. Oh also Aunt asus's website they will tell you that this laptop only supports 32 GB of RAM but I currently have 64 GB of RAM on it and it registers all of it... You can tell from Windows task Manager that they artificially make it so you can't access two of the ram slots it was supposed to have as well so they further undermine the theme of upgradability. It does come with the gddr6 1650, and to this device is credit when I put it through hell playing about 10 hours of video games yesterday, it kept the GPU very cool, however the laptop's underside got almost certainly OSHA violation level of hot, so under no circumstances should you buy this for business usage.Ultimately it did however over perform benchmarks I had seen previously on YouTube in Halo infinite and the performance was not bad. I will say with all of this bad it is still the best asus product I have used thus far, I will update this review again if that changes.",Very Underwhelming and it has the worst UEFI/BIOS I have ever interacted with,2023-02-11,3.0

It can last a long time for normal texting and surfing etc., but if working, it goes fairly fast.  You therefore need to keep a charging port open to use to charge.  With no separate battery, it uses the connections leaving you with what is left for your devices  Then you have left a C and a USB 3.2, HDMI.  I don't use HDMI but might for a second display, but with my Wacom needing usb 3.2, my 2 external hard drives also need one 3.2 and one C.

And to add an extra SSD requires using the supplied ribbon, however my black ribbon lock fell into the computer so I can't add an extra SSD.A tip, if you want the red keyboard backlight to remain on while in use the setting is in the BIOS.Overall the performance of the laptop for the cost is very much worth buying. So yes I recommend it. However if you intend to add an extra SSD or RAM, better have someone with lots of experience and tiny fingers. BTW I have 5 IT degrees and still found upgrading a challenge.",Why 4 **** and not 5,2023-08-24,4.0,R3FZ947DHLNXKU,Executive B,3.0,When I first received the laptop the box was damaged and I thought the computer was damaged since I plugged it up and didn 2019t see any lights and it was not turning on. I called Acer support they told me you have to click the charger in till you hear 2 clicks and not 1 which I felt like should have been stated in the instructions somewhere or something. Fast forward 3 days later I turned my computer on and it was just at a black screen nothing was happening. Turned it off then back on black screen still present. Called Acer support told them that after the computer tried to up date and next day I turned it on that was present they walked me through so steps to reset the software and 5 minutes later it was running again. To say the least it 2019s fast it plays Fortnite really well with no issues and few other games I play. The downside to this PC is all the bloatware I tried deleting the bloatware some won 2019t let me delete and the others I click delete and it freezes up on the task. The keyboard only is red but you can adjust the brightness and or turn it off. Overall I 2019d have to give the computer 3 stars if you 2019re looking for a decent entry gaming laptop this is a good competitor.,Decent machine,2023-07-25,3.0

This machine was purchased for my company and we found this issue a major problem in our operations. However, I said ""It's fine, we will work around it and use a mouse"". That went alright for the first 10 minutes until I found that some of the keys aren't functioning the way they should be. This includes the brightness of the screen (bright and dim) seems to refresh and tab through sections vs lowering and raising the brightness. The other function that doesn't work is the volume buttons ( again, up and down ). This became frustrating quite quickly. Again, I said we will work around this issue. The final straw was when we were setting up the laptop. We found that we couldn't install drivers for the touch pad because they are not available. Also, we are not able to use the finger print feature to unlock the computer. Again, we are not able to install drivers because they are not available. At the end of the day, we have decided to move forward with a return and refund.PLEASE BE AWARE******THIS IS NOT A BAD LAPTOP. For the price, this laptop is exceptional. It will get the job done if you plan to use a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse. With the occasional ""laptop"" setting. I am still able to function with added steps but it becomes frustrating as I operate on other laptops that function the way that I want them too. Please do not be afraid to purchase this laptop as renewed because it is exactly that. I am still able to do all the functions of my job as needed but takes different steps.

This one has a awesome prime day sale plus I got a 990pro and 32gb crucial memory(max it takes).(edit) I also just noticed it does not support HDR huge thumbs down.1.Biggest draw backs I noticed it's kind of a pain to upgrade you need to take the whole bottom off 11 screws all of which do not want to come out of holes because of locktight used on them.2. Even when playing older games it will max out the GPU doesn't matter if it's 1080 or 2k constantly have the 4060 under full load and fans running high and the CPU under full load.3. Performance is good not blown away by it. Didn't realize the 4060 wasn't running under a full power load would of been better off with a 3080ti laptop with full power that were on sale.4. Needs more 3.2 USB ports  has 2 USB3 but the USB ports are on the right handed side causing me to loose more room for my mouse space poor design. Put one on the back or the other side. The back does have 2 USB-C so ill try a adapter and see if that works. ( it does)5.Bios leaves much to be desired. Really has everything blocked off and does not give you much control over it.6.

But when I researched it says it does.The good1.Thermals didn't seem to get much hotter then 71-78c on the GPU-CPU under full load for long time. Up to (82c update 9-27-23) use a good fan.2.

Don't use gaming setup under the nitro app keeps fans at full blast use performance. Fans at full blast can rival and 747 Plane in Db range  if you leave it on gaming profile. Do not do this you cant even hear games. It leaves fans on full all the time in the Nitro Center.I do have it all upgraded running 2 990 pros 2tb each one with a heat sink one without about 10c difference.  32gb of memory. Maxed everything out I could. Runs great with a $cooler it has one big fan in the middle can always keep it around 70c. Don't expect to be running many games on ultra unless they support dss 3.2. But overall alot of games on medium or high. Some on ultra. I'm happy for the $1000. Sale I got on it. Put another $400-$600 in it and should last me 5-7 yrs of mid tier gaming.

Do not expect it to run the latest games or any graphically intensive applications.  With that stated, I am utilizing these at a non profit charity that which mostly utilizes cloud based applications.  These computers work very well at this task while providing the future proofing of being Windows 11 compliant.We are replacing ACER Aspire E15 series laptops with this model.  The E15s were mostly generation 7 & 8 I3 and i5 models with SATA III SSDs and 8GB of RAM.  The NVMe drives are much faster than the older SATA III drives.  I miss the extra RAM, but not enough to crack open these cases for upgrades.  My volunteers appreciate the lighter weight and slimmer size.  I don't remember the last time we actually utilized an optical drive or card reader which were lost with the slimmer case.These have smaller batteries than our older models.  That coupled with the CPU and RAM workload increase, means that I anticipate 5 - 6 hours of battery life utilizing basic cloud based applications.  Streaming movies or playing basic games will decrease the life more.  Non CPU intensive desktop productivity software should increase the battery life.  The power port is proprietary so you will need to carry the brick and cords if you need more battery life during your day.  From an IT prospective, this is a blessing due to the number of infected USB C chargers that have begun popping up in public spaces.Most of the volunteers in the organization are older and greatly appreciate the larger display size.  There is no touch display option.  The maximum resolution is 1920x1080, but the overall quality does not keep up with mid level or elite laptops.  The viewing angle is about 120 degrees from the side and less from the top.  Graphics performance is low.  The colors are not as rich and the contrast is not as dynamic as better displays.  This does include HDMI 2.0.  I do not think it could drive a display with higher resolution very well though.  It is fine for plugging presentations in to a projector or large display.  I do not see much improvement on this display vs the 2017 - 2019 ACER E15 series laptops these are replacing.The webcam is basic.  The speakers are small and face down.  There is a single microphone.  If you speak on calls, a headset is a must.  If you listen on calls, this is adequate provided your space is quiet enough for the small speakers.  The overall sound quality is a compromise between value and quality leaning heavily on value.The keyboard is textured.  It is not backlit.  There is not indication that Caps lock or Number Lock are engaged.  So far, I prefer it to the usual flat chiclet keyboards that haunt modern laptops.  The key response is good.  The number pad keys are smaller than the regular keys and some of the buttons are not in standard 10 key locations.  The keyboard also does not use the standard inverted T for the arrow keys.  This is either a learning curve or an annoyance depending on the user.  Time will tell regarding dust and foreign debris issues and how difficult it is to change a key, switch or the entire keyboard.The touchpad is large enough to cover the display area adequately.  It is sensitive enough to cover tap clicking or actual clicking depending on user preference.  I do miss the button that disables the touchpad to eliminate palm pressing, but that disappeared with optical drives on every computer.The ports are great.  This laptop has  2 USB 3.2 and one USB C on the left side, and one USB 2.0 on the right side.  It also has gigabit ethernet and HDMI 2.0 on the left side and a headphone port on the right side.  The SD card reader has disappeared to no big loss.  Many of my volunteers prefer corded mice and happen to be right handed.  A USB port on the right side is really nice.  The power port is proprietary since this is USB C instead of Thunderbolt 3/4.  That is a nice range of current and future connectivity.  The average user will not need to utilize a dock or USB hub with this laptop.The WI-FI supports both 2.4 and 5.0 Ghz protocols.  It maxes out at WI-FI 5 speeds.  The built in ethernet port is gigabit which maxes out at 125mbps.  Both are adequate for streaming, web browsing, email, and basic Internet use.  Most home networks are gigabit so this slots in very well.  I was able to maintain transfers at 2.3GBe with a USB 3.2 to 2.5GBe adapter.  There is no wireless upgrade option.You can access the main board and components with nothing more than a 00 Phillips screwdriver.  There is a single RAM slot and it utilizes NVMe 3.0.  The base model is a little light on both RAM and storage, but for a workstation, it is adequate.  For a more power user, you can upgrade both, which is nice and becoming rare in most laptops.  The NVMe drive is not heat shielded nor is it installed in a place with good airflow.  I would not be surprised to encounter heat throttling during periods of heavy use.  The overall drive life may be compromised as well.  Time will tell.  There are no additional unused SATA, PCI, or NVMe ports for expansion.  You cannot upgrade the CPU and there is no expansion port to add discrete graphics.  No surprise there.I immediately exited Windows S mode during initial setup.  Any program that won't allow a user to even utilize a different browser, isn't right for me.  This may be nice if you are attempting to keep users away from applications and websites of questionable origin but our desktop software will never be listed in the MS store and our cloud based software is not stable in Edge.The bottom line is that this laptop is designed for non power users and companies looking for a laptop that is more powerful and less controlled than the average Chromebook.  If your user experience is surfing the Internet, streaming videos, checking email, and running software that will never be listed in an App Store, this is a great option.  If you want to play games, or edit video or graphics, this is not the right choice for you.  Based on previous ACER experience, we anticipate 5 years of service out of these which is a great return of investment.",Not a powerhouse but acceptable for low end workstation use,2023-04-09,4.0,R2PYXX8IEARFZ4,Klaymate,224.0,"If I thought anyone would read the one to two star reviews, that's more likely what I would have rated this product. The laptop itself is fine but the operating system experience is really the part that makes me regret my purchase.For context my wife owns a slightly earlier model of this laptop and it seemed decent so I purchased the Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-53S3 model. I opted to spring for the model with a decent graphics card (Iris XE) and larger solid state drive(storage) because my intent was to use this to play low end/low effort games on the couch while the kiddo and wife watched shows or movies. Even though it suffers from a shortage of RAM, it does seem like it will serve the purpose however I am disappointed with the user experience overall.Straight to the point: Windows 11 is awful. My wife's laptop came with windows 10, I helped her set it up and customize it the way she likes it. The laptop I just purchased came with windows 11 and it is an entirely different story. The initial setup alone was exhausting with multiple attempts by Microsoft to get me to agree to letting them track everything I do, including specific text regarding logging everything I type as well as my browser history and web interactions. They also attempt to sell you Microsoft services right off the bat in the form of free trial periods for 365, their cloud services and more. A few of them even note ""credit card required"" next to the automatically checked box if you wanted to continue. To me this felt pretty crummy. I just bought a 500 dollar laptop and they are already trying to get more money out of me before I even finish the initial setup. Acer adds to the issue by also offering deals, software and registering the product in exchange for services I have absolutely no interest in.It would be alright if it stopped there but unfortunately that is only the beginning of my disdain. I have only had the laptop for about 19 days and yet it seems like every other time I boot up the system something new pops up. The first few times it was programs installing themselves and congratulating me on my newly unrequested/not permitted acquisitions. Acer took it upon themselves to load Norton Antivirus on my system well after I finished the initial setup process. Icons for Amazon web games are created and appear in my start bar/menu randomly. I've deleted the Microsoft edge browser icon off my desktop and start bar and yet it continues to reappear. Its asked to update 3 times in the 19 days that I've owned it. It seems like one of out every 3 times I start the system it seems slow and sluggish to fully load windows only to find out something has been added without my consent. Which is especially anoying seeing that the system already comes with tons of applications pre loaded similar to buying a new smart phone. Tiktok, messanger apps, amazon prime, Disney+ and more, perhaps Im getting old but I would much rather install what I want myself then have to uninstall tons of apps I will never use from the system.As stated before there is not much RAM, even on the higher end model I purchased. Checking the performance page in task manager you can see that even without any other self installed apps running, windows and Acer's apps consume 4 of the 8 GB of system RAM. Uninstalling and shutting down a bunch of truly unessential apps and services I was able to get it down to 3/8 GB. The 256GB SSD is also already partially consumed by windows itself which no amount of uninstalling pre loaded apps seems to resolve.It does have enough resources to play games including some older titles that have 3D graphic requirements. I have not tried to play modern titles or expect it to play more graphic intensive titles but 3D style graphic MMORPGs, Adventure games and the like run pretty well. It does seem to have some issues playing intros and cut scenes sometimes and most annoying is the fact that letting the laptop go to sleep by inactivity or closing the lid causes most games to either crash outright or become slow and consistently stutter to the point where you have to close and reopen the application to resolve the issue.Battery life is about where I would expect it. Playing graphic games seems to drain it pretty quick. 90% to 40% in about 2 hours of running a low end games. It will last a short flight or a long movie but I expect to have to have it plugged in when ever I wanna really sink into playing something. Speakers are good enough as I wouldn't expect anything great out of a compact laptop. Screen looks crisp and bright.I cannot say I will likely return the laptop just based on the fact that almost all other laptops available at this point will will also have Windows 11 installed. Its not really an issue with the hardware as much as it's just the operating system that really rubs me the wrong way. I don't feel like its my personal computer. It feels more like a smart phone. I am having less and less faith the system will stay how I left it. The updates are forced and can only be put off for a max of 3 weeks. Gone are the days of getting a system how you like it and it staying that way. Here to stay is the age of only partial owning your system, being subjected to constant updates and with that the assumption its going to run worse and worse over time, plus always having some new unwanted surprise in store every time it is powered up.",Pretty disappointing,2023-01-04,3.0

The fingerprint sensor inside the power button is a great innovation I didn't even know I needed.If there is any niggle to note, the lid is a little tricky to open with one hand. The hinge is strong enough to keep the device closed, and the laptop itself is so light to begin with, that lifting on the front of the lid will usually just slide the whole thing around on the desk instead of opening it up. I have to lightly brace the back of the laptop with one hand and opening it with the other. It takes barely a touch, but it's quickly become a habit to use both hands to open the laptop.

It looks like that the laptop wants to connect but it immediately disconnects.4. The embedded  fingerprint reader in the power button is very flaky, it worked the first time, did not survive a reboot. Enrolled two fingers again, worked while ON and again, disappeared after the reboot.5. It does not have Thunderbolt ports, only USB3.x, therefore the backup to either and external USB drive or a NAS, is about 330-350Mb/s as opposed to the same external devices from an LG17 which has the Thunderbolt ports, the backup rate is about 1100Mb/s.6. The Samsung 16 Laptop is about 2X the weight of the slightly larger LG17.7. In all fairness, the $1750 cost of the Samsung Laptop is substantially higher with lower performance than other comparable laptops.

It seems with all the things coming up 32 might be necessary to run all we like to do  Cannot add more Ram, can add/upgrade the hard drive.Very QuietKeys fabulousTouchpad -- large but really nice (and I hate touchpads ... I use my Wacom Graphics Tablet. )Battery respectable; however, it depends on if you use 120 hz or 60 hz, and what all you are doing.  It can last a long time for normal texting and surfing etc., but if working, it goes fairly fast.  You therefore need to keep a charging port open to use to charge.  With no separate battery, it uses the connections leaving you with what is left for your devices  Then you have left a C and a USB 3.2, HDMI.  I don't use HDMI but might for a second display, but with my Wacom needing usb 3.2, my 2 external hard drives also need one 3.2 and one C.  I work on graphics, photos, etc., all day, and need those back ups.  For me it is critical to get the Anker Prime 6-in-1 USB C Charging Station, 140W Compact Power Strip for Work and Travel, 5 ft Detachable Extension Cord with 6 Ports, to give me some additional ports and make my workflow more comfortable as well as everything else or something like it.  So consider that you may need that.  I would say that is my only Con besides Windows 11 ....grrr.  I had been using Win 10 because my old laptop could not be upgraded to Windows 11.  So lots of making it better for me.  THis laptop has Win 11 Pro.I love that it integrates with my phone and tablet with ease,  It is a great laptop.  Lightweight.  Samsung did think this out well.  The screen... wow....  it is amazing.  You have to see it to believe it.I could not get the beige one as it was not available at the time of purchase in this build.  But you can purchase skins that are pretty and are designed to fit exactly the shape.  Bought one but have not put it on the laptop.As for a noisy fan others talk about, I have not heard the fans kicking in.  It runs not hot but warmer than my HP was.  About the same as My Sony Vaio.  This laptop is a really great investment.By the way, it has a back lit keyboard, no touchscreen (I did not use anyway).  Feels sturdy, I just wish it had more ports and a longer battery life.  Came with 60W charger and cord.  Amoled screen.  Fingerprint scanner on power button which since I am using at home  I bypassed using it.  Graphite not a bad color, and I do not find it is a fingerprint magnet.  Did I say I love it!  Thank you Amazon and Samsung.",The Best!!!!

When I took it out the box, immediately, it was running slowly and glitching within the first 2 weeks of having it. Partially because I downloaded 3 small apps on my computer and majority of the storage on the computer was already full (???).2. When I tried to move some of my items to the sd card, there were a few errors that came up as a result and I had no idea why.3. After a while, the caps lock buttons will randomly kind of reverse itself and you 2019ll have to find a way around to using, this problem came up within a year of having it. When I press the caps lock button, it might work correctly, but sometimes my letters will be lowercase with the caps lock ON, and I 2019ll have to turn it OFF in order to get capital letters lol. It 2019s weird lmao.4. It generally just has trouble reading the sd card, and as of writing this, I 2019m going to have to get a new one as it 2019s not reading the card at all.Generally I 2019d give it a 3 star because it still works fine overall and it could be worse but I 2019ll give it an extra star for being pink XD!! 2b50 fe0f",Buy something better if you can,2023-07-12,3.0

You can throw a lot at it and it won't budge, however, do be mindful that this is still a laptop.  Cooling will be the primary issue as is the case with most other laptops.The good- The version I received came with a 10 core 12th gen i7, a dedicated 4050 GPU with 6GB of VRAM.  This is more than sufficient for my gaming, photoshop, programming, and productions needs.  I debated splurging on a laptop with a larger 17"" screen, for my purposes though 15"" is enough.  The brightness and clarity are great.  144Hz is an excellent feature, but considering the nature of this machine I would prefer 120Hz.  Allow me to clarify, I understand Hz has everything to do with the screen refresh rate.  I also understand most games can be capped around 120FPS, by capping the two it can allow cooling headroom.The mediocre- at $1K is 512GB of SSD space the best you can really do?  I immediately took my machine apart and installed an aftermarket 4TB crucial NVMe and a 4TB Samsung 980 Evo, in addition to replacing the RAM from 16GB to 64GB.  I understand this sounds like overkill, and it is... to an extent.  Beyond gaming I run virtualization software and edit photography shots for my side gig.  Running virtualized labs exhausts a lot of resources, and due to the nature of travel associated with my work, I can't always utilize my desktop.  Audio isn't the greatest on this machine either, the sounds are washed out due to the speakers being place on the bottom.The bad - expandability.  This is 2023, disk space should be expandable by now without voiding the warranty.  I am well aware I can purchase an external drive, but it blows my mind that modern day devices have the ability to be customized - e.g Disk space/RAM, etc, but the warranty must be void in order to do so.  These are relatively low risk modifications.The ugly- cooling, 100%.  MSI BIOS by default runs turbo, add Windows 11 to the mix and you have a deadly concoction on your hands.  This toasty boi almost peaked around 92C.  Yes, modern day equipment can run this hot, will it stand the test of time though?  I am not one to take that risk.  I managed to take 20C off of my average temps, which should hopefully increase the longevity of my laptop.What would my suggestion to the manufacturer be?- First and foremost disable turbo, it's unnecessary.  The laptop is certainly capable of performing under extreme workloads but it's not exactly practical when the temperature is teetering around it's throttle limit.- A thicker base for a more robust heatsink.  I know this is counterintuitive to the specific design of this product since it is supposed to be thing.  This could expand the life of the product though.Suggestions for the consumer- Turn off turbo in BIOS, it requires enabling advanced mode but the rewards are worth it.- Get rid of Windows 11, it's absolute garbage in its current state.  Maybe by the next iteration they will have fixed it.  For now, install Windows 10 via USB or install a user friendly Linux Distro like Mint, Debian, or Ubuntu.- Purchase an aftermarket laptop stand/cooler.  I don't have any particular one to suggest since I'm still in the search for something I think will perform the job correctly.Final thoughtsThis is a solid 7.5/10 laptop.  It's not bleeding edge by today's standards, but it will do more than just get you by especially if you are a student on a budget who enjoys games on the side.  This laptop also serves as a great multipurpose device with a few component modifications.  That all depends on if you are willing to risk voiding the warranty or not.  As an IT professional I suggest not doing so if you are not comfortable with the thought of that.","The good, the bad, and the ugly",2023-06-03,4.0,R2LET4Y973RTQB,Miao,0.0,"I received this 9/11, and start use it on 9/13 after re-installing the Microsoft system. I found the keyboard, screen, electricity and attachments are all nice. This is a relative cheap price according to the set-ups.However, the TouchPad is completely not usable. I opened it 9/12 and found the TouchPad is off, so I tried fn-f3 and re-installing the system. When I start again on 9/13, the TouchPad is still off. I also tried to install msi TouchPad drive and turn off the I2C HID in device management, but nothing changes. I may consider this as a hardware break.I can use my mouse to control the computer, and I have a lot of work to do on it, so there is a large chance that I will not return it or change it (except the seller is kind enough to mail me a new one before I give it back :>). I will use the MSI warranty instead, but it will be several months after that.I typed this rate on 9/14 00:30, after tried several hours trying to repair TouchPad. I will recommend this, since 700-800 dollars is really not expensive under this set of laptop; I also believe that the TouchPad broken on a new laptop is really rare thing.

It basically functions....Pro/ConPro: It functions.It can handle the business side of things such as running a Point of Sales system and VPN and handle me using it to work on website and other business required processes at a decent speed. Nothing super fast but nothing too slow either.It looks nice and it will NOW login correctly and in a semi timely manner so I can start work day relatively easily on the go.Microsoft support did help me get past login error the device had. Even if in a roundabout way.That is basically it for good.Cons: To start I was able to get laptop and get a sign in going with the proper account on microsoft account. Day 2 went to login and after putting in password it suggested I make a PIN I said skip for now. It takes me back to login screen to put in account email and password again. Back to PIN screen to make or skip. Tried skipping. Back to Login screen again. Third time I selected create PIN. ""Error cannot create PIN at this time.""....... It did this for all manners of different cycles. Could never create PIN and could never skip PIN entry.... took 3 hours of dealing with Microsoft support and editting stuff in BIOS to get the laptop to skip the PIN entry and even let me use the laptop. So now I can login without PIN entry though I still cannot create a PIN for account which shouldn't even be required since I also already have a microsoft authenticator and a few other security layers for account.Con 2 its slow.... for a brand new laptop it should not be running same speed for downloads as my 9 year old laptop that I am have as backup. (battery dead and only works when plugged in. screen flickering so I know its going to stop working soon.) I can compare speeds easily. Same network same conditions only difference is my old laptop also has a ton of other things running just from past years. (Extra start ups and background programs.) So this Brand New computer should not be running slower.It also cannot even run some basic game emulators (Free games no I am not stealing them. Indie developers) But for those who don't know these are usually pixel games that don't use much computer power to run. My old and dying laptop runs them just slightly  better..but I got this new laptop so I could run them better.Con 3 the keys are a bit off. They don't always register a full downpress for if you type faster. I have been using computers for a long time and tend to type rather fast. I know I make errors and such but am pretty accurate most of the time. This laptop it seems to not register them unless key is pressed rather heavily down and deliberately.Summary: Honestly if it didnt take me 12 plus hours to install all the work related programs and set up all the things in it so I could run business side of things. I would want to replace this in an instant. Maybe try same one but get one less faulty? Or if it is just 'How this laptop is'. I might get a different one.Sadly I have already put a lot of time into getting this one going and with the business stuff on it I don't want to just send it back without doing a very hard scrub of it to make sure no business information is still saved on it which would probably void some kind of warranty.If you want a laptop to function as something to just watch Youtube. Edit pictures or just do other similarly menial things.

El vendedor es consciente de estos detalles, pero intencionalmente no les anucia a los clientes la garant 00eda anulada ni el reemplazo con un disco duro barato.I hope some future buyers will find this review useful as an alert to the misleading, shady, and uncooperative business practices of this seller. I bought this Victus Gaming Laptop from this seller sometime around November/December 2022. I enjoyed the laptop for about a month before the hard drive failed. In January 2023, the laptop would no longer start-up, and I was met with a ""3F0"" error. I called HP 2014the manufacturer of the laptop that the seller says is responsible for the warranty 2014assuming that the laptop was still under warranty given that it was within one year of purchase. It took a few weeks to work with them over the phone to run tests remotely to assess the problem, during which I couldn't use the laptop for gaming. Ultimately, they determined the problem was due to the SSD hard drive failure. This didn't make sense at the time since I had only used the laptop for light gaming, never having even moved it from my desk. HP requested that I mail in the laptop for repairs. I later received a message from the HP repair team notifying me that it was a hard drive failure due to a ""cheap hard drive replacement"" from a 3rd party. They also informed me that any 3rd party modifications automatically void the warranty, so HP would NOT repair the laptop for free under warranty and instead requested ~$450 to repair it. When I told HP that the laptop arrived to me with these modifications, they responded that they receive many laptops for repairs with these cheap hard drive replacements after purchasing the laptop on Amazon. They acknowledged that this was not my fault but that the warranty was still voided. They suggested I contact the seller instead.I contacted the seller and described the problem. I reasonably requested a refund or other reasonable solution. They responded unapologetically that they ""are not responsible for the warranty which is all up to the manufacture"" and that they only provide the ""standard 30 days return period"". First off, their unapologetic tone and inflexibility in trying to find a reasonable solution are insulting to the customer. Secondly, the upgrades are listed on the page; however, they do not advertise that there is no warranty or recourse if the laptop breaks down. They knowingly say that the ""warranty is up to the manufacturer"" but know that these upgrades will void the warranty. They do not alert their customers to this. It's suspicious that my laptop should break down after 1 month / 30 days, which is right outside their return window. Not notifying the customer that the laptop will not come with a warranty while also replacing the hard drive with a cheap replacement is clearly misleading and disrespectful to customers. I will file a complaint with Amazon and work as many avenues as possible to ensure that other customers do not fall victim to this unfair policy and misleading business practices.","Be wary that warranty is void on purchase, seller is unapologetic and misleading",2023-03-30,1.0

I get it. I have the Gigabyte Aero 15 XD, which is a 4K OLED, RTX 3070, multiple ports, great speakers, great display, fast processor, yada yada yada.Compared to my Gigabyte Aero 15 XD, the Gigabyte G5 KF, is lacking in screen resolution (1080p), port features (for example, the USB-A do not drive external displays, can't power laptop through USB-A, HDMI not connected to GPU), speakers are tinny, display isn't as crisp, processor isn't as powerful, and so on.But we're talking a sub-$1000 machine versus a $2000 machine.

The test model I trained completed in 5 minutes on a 4060 versus 90 minutes for the 860M (1152 CUDA cores).But I digress, it is perfect for machine learning, and only slightly slower than my Desktop 3060 and 3070 machines for deep learning training.I did try one AAA video game: Starfield, ultra settings. It only did 30-40 fps. But it was playable. Lower settings did get >60fps.To summarize, as a portable machine learning machine, it is AWESOME with a capital ""A"".

I had been using an AMD 3200u for several years, but it was clearly showing its age. I was pleasantly surprised to come across this laptop with a 5625u at such an affordable price. The Geekbench scores are quite close to those of the 5600u.The first thing I did, and I highly recommend this to anyone else, is to add a 16GB (8GB works fine too) stick of 3200MHz RAM, bringing the laptop's total to 24GB. The improvement in performance with dual-channel memory is significant.What's most surprising is the battery life, considering the power and the large 17"" screen. While I can't provide exact numbers due to varying usage patterns, I can easily get several hours of work done before needing to recharge.The screen is decent for my needs 2014not outstanding, but far from terrible.Although I primarily purchased this laptop for work, I couldn't resist installing a few games out of curiosity. To my amazement, this little APU held its own. It can handle some older titles at high settings and even newer ones at lower settings. What surprised me the most was when I tried playing Doom Eternal. Running it at 720p on all low settings, the game was surprisingly playable. While I wouldn't recommend this laptop as a gaming PC, it's worth mentioning that it can handle older titles, emulations, or kids' games with ease.","Nothing is more powerful for the price, battery life is insane.",2023-09-11,5.0,R3ELWUII2ICCOI,Les,0.0,"The good first: It is a good laptop for the price for a new laptop and had no problems beyond not being able to register with Lanovo for warranty out side of the US and no IWS warranty for the IdeaPad models. If you live in the US the laptop can be registered with Lanovo for one year depot service and also comes with the ability to purchase extended coverages.The shipping internationally was fast (I chose the faster delivery option, I have also noticed that the import deposit is less with the faster delivery option, so initial cost paid is actually less). Part of the import deposit was refunded a few days after receiving. I have noticed this on a few purchases and find the way Amazon handles the shipping to and import costs very good and cost effective.  No surprises and unexpected broker/warehouse fees. I really like the way they handle it, a big plus.The reason for the return was although new, Lanovo would not honor the warranty when purchased and shipped outside of the US. I have since noticed that these laptops, from the US, are being offered online from local sellers, and some research showed also without the ability to get the factory warranty and/or the extended warranty. Shame on Lanovo, dumping their overstock in other countries without warranty.The problem came when I was told I could return it for a refund. The chat associates were not clear about the total amount I would be refunded. Worse, currently Amazon does not provide prepaid shipping and/or carrier to return the item. I was told I was on my own. When questioning if I would be reimbursed for the return shipping the response was very ambiguous. The cost ended up being almost $170 to ship it back. I contacted Amazon associates multiple times trying to get a definitive answer if I would get a FULL refund of the shipping cost.  The responses were very non committal as to full refund and method of refund. At last I insisted that I needed to know if I would be fully reimbursed for the return shipping and that they use the words full refund (as opposed to ""we will ""help"" with the return shipping"") and send me an email stating the same. After Amazon received the laptop I was promptly reimbursed in full for the cost of the laptop, remainder of import fees, the shipping fees to send it to me. But only $20 for the return shipping cost. Contacting a chat associate and explaining the situation I was told $20 was the standard amount they reimbursed. Then that in this situation a total of $75 was the maximum they could reimburse. When I insisted I was told I would get full reimbursement the response was, ""Were you promised?"".  And the associate went on to indicate they should not of told me that I would get full reimbursment.I asked to escalate, he said he would connect me by phone, but felt I would get the same response.I did not. It was handled very nicely and professionally. And I did receive full reimbursement in less than 3 days.When I asked the person I spoke to about returning items going forward should I purchase an item with an issue in the future I was told they were working on providing prepaid labels for return shipping.Amazon is really good about making customers whole when there is an issue with an item ordered. I check them first for availability and cost. I will combine smaller wants to meet the $49 free international shipping and usually it is reasonably fast.It is just this particular situation had no clear policy when dealing with the associates and was very stressful. I hope Amazon fixes the prepaid return shipping issue.",International Buyers Beware!!!,2023-09-22,3.0

Optical drive, 2TB HD, backlit keyboard, 3 USB ports, nice large screen. I bought it to replace a similar HP laptop and I'm pleased with the upgrade.I docked it a star because of issues during setup. I took it out of the box, fired it up, breezed thru the setup steps and etc. Rebooted and suddenly it was crawling, just laboring along at an alarmingly poor pace. I finally managed to reboot and it got stuck in the reboot loop. After a half an hour I had to pull the plug. Then when I booted again it went right back into the loop. I had to go into the startup menu (F12 I think) and restore the system, which worked although it was still creeping and way too slow.And of course Windows Update was the culprit. One second after I was up and running and online the computer started downloading and installing updates from MS which was effectively gunking up the whole system behind the scenes. I went ahead and changed the settings then downloaded and installed the (huge) updates and since then it's been humming along with nary a problem. It's just a heads-up in case you buy one of these things and find yourself in a similar pickle.","Great deal, fine laptop.",2018-11-20,4.0,R2G3UVADD0R9G,Debbie Seely,0.0,"I bought this computer just under two years ago. I only got to use it for 14 months total. (I had to off-gas it for six months before I could use it) When I did use it the computer ran well and was fast, but there were several issues. The first one was that the screen had permanent smudges on it, like someone took a greasy finger and ran it down the side of the screen in two places. But it never would wipe off.The other was that after about eight months or so, all of a sudden I had issues with the modem disconnecting. If the computer went to ""sleep"" I would have to restart the entire modem. Some mornings everything would start up upon turning the computer on, but other mornings I had to reboot the modem again. I though it was the modem, but it turns out it was the computer, for now that I've replaced the laptop, the modem connects just fine.Finally, the worst thing was that a couple of weeks ago, while I was working on a college paper, the week before finals, the computer just died. No warning. The computer repair store said that HP's were rather well known to do this. I am so angry that I didn't eve get a year and a half's use out of it! The computer before I bought this one lasted almost seven years, and it was a cheap one compared to this HP. I will never buy an HP again. From reading the reviews, it looks like I am not the only one that found out the hard way that HP mother boards are crap.

It also voided the manufacturer's warranty on those specific parts. HP helped me solve the problem since they have 24/7 service,  and this was a Friday evening. I received instructions from the seller the following week on how to fix the problem which I had already corrected with HP's help.

During the initial setup, and for the first 2 days, it was moving a little sluggish, but the Task Manager showed that it was Windows processes that was using most of the CPU and RAM at the time (happens to all computers from time to time). Outside of that, the performance is flawless. I have used it to play Halo: Master Chief Collection, and it runs like a beauty!Wi-Fi speeds are immaculate! The Wi-Fi chip performs flawlessly! Not to mention that it is also equipped with an ethernet port as well. No complaints here.Screen:Upon first bootup of the desktop (after the setup screen), I IMMEDIATELY saw the quality of the screen. Viewing angles are just about perfect as well! This is my first foray into 144Hz territory, and I love it! Transitions are smooth, and I often move the mouse pointer from one corner to another just to enjoy the frame rate. The screen gets plenty bright for indoor use, and suitable for outdoor use as well. Direct sunlight, however, is a bit of a letdown. At the same time, I don't like or suggest using PCs in direct sunlight if possible, as the heat is not good for the device.The color accuracy leaves a little to be desired, as it does not provide 100% of the sRGB color gamut (around 46-55%, I think), so be careful with photo processing. The screen has a matte surface, so there are NO reflections to speak of.Hardware:That being said, this device is great with high/low temps as well! It doesn't slow down with the cold, and it doesn't throttle when hot. The fans do a great job keeping the laptop cool and preventing throttling, even while gaming. Maybe I should try gaming outside in the sunlight....? Perhaps a future edit is in order.Back on track, the fans are audible while performing CPU-heavy tasks (gaming and video processing), but completely quiet while using simple processes, like web browsing and document editing. In fact, I thought the fans turned off, but I can feel a very slight breeze from the back of the device at all times. For simple tasks, this is actually just fine to use in your lap. The rear vents prevent overheating when used on your lap as well. I do not suggest using it in your lap while gaming.The hinge for the screen is sturdy, and the laptop material feels durable and looks good. The keyboard and wrist-rests get smudges, though. Not too fond with that. It is easy to clean with a microfiber cloth, though, so all is not lost.Now, the not so good (don't worry, the list is short):Battery:The battery is easily the greatest letdown for this computer. For everyday tasks, you can get 3-5hrs of battery life, depending on different factors (fan speed, screen brightness, backlit keyboard settings, speaker volume, etc.). However, when gaming, the battery life TANKS! You might get 1:30hrs if you are lucky. For older titles, these metrics change by a lot. But for Halo, for example, I was at 50% in about 40mins. I imagine that video processing would deliver slightly better results, but not aby too much. Keep your plug handy.Speakers:The speakers are decent. Bass is non-existent, but I did not expect that. The vocals, however, are rather clear. The speakers do provide a stereo experience, with the left and right channels working as intended (great for shooting games to know the origin of bullets and footsteps). I typically use Bluetooth or external speakers, so I don't have too many complaints about this.Conclusion:This laptop is a very solid performer for whatever tasks that you want to do, but be mindful of the battery limitations. Keeping this in mind, you won't regret this purchase!",Very fast computer  with mediocre battery life,2023-06-19,5.0,RJPS27EA0F9I9,jesus soto,3.0,"After using the computer for 1 month and a half, it began to show failures. on the screen. and I call for the guarantee and they answer me that I have no way to change it.

I've had this Ideapad for about a week and I'm still not sure if I'll keep it.1]You need a Microsoft account to set it up. You cannot skip it, you NEED to add an email address at the start. It 2019s been a while since I 2019ve set up a laptop, but is this the new standard? Why? It 2019s one thing to require an account if I were to use OneDrive or Word/Excel, but to just set up a laptop? Seems pushy. Speaking of which 20262]The laptop starts in Windows S mode  201cto protect its users. 201d And by  201cprotecting its users 201d, it locks you into the Microsoft ecosystem where you cannot use any apps not Microsoft approved. No Chrome, no Adobe, nothing. Bless your heart, Microsoft, but can I use the laptop I paid for to do whatever I want without you blocking me from the get-go? I 2019m perfectly fine with S mode as an option, but forcing it on me and requiring me to go through extra steps to get it off is an unnecessary encumbrance. Oh, and you 2019ll need a Microsoft account to get rid of it (there are tutorials showing how to leave S mode without an account, but they 2019re temporary).3]The anti glare, ironically, hurts my eyes. No matter what angle I adjust the screen, no matter what light source I use, the whiteness of the screen washes out the text. I need to use accessibility settings to read pages, which I 2019ve never had to do before. Even so, there are certain pictures, like a light object against a white background, that I just cannot see with this screen. I have to dim it 50%.4]It 2019s a bit slow. Switching tabs takes a few seconds. Sometimes it lags when I type. Not deal breakers, but considering this is a brand new laptop with nothing installed, it 2019s a bit concerning.5]When you type, a little  201cabc 201d notification pops up. Of all the things, this is the one that irrationally pisses me off. Why is this here? To tell me when I 2019m on capslock? Don 2019t you think I 2019d figure out if I have capslock after, you know, I press the capslock button? I cannot fathom why anyone thought this was a good idea. Yes, I figured out how to disable it, but why was it there in the first place?Anyway, the laptop works for what I want: watching videos, doing light spreadsheet work, and checking emails. I cannot complain about that. But I had to do a lot of fiddling to find settings to make it usable, while previous laptops worked fine right out of the box. I 2019m still deciding if the pet peeves above are irritating enough for me to return it. But so far, so 2026ok.Update: I've decided to return it. I couldn't get the screen to work decently; videos and text blended too much into the white background. And it was tabs were too slow to navigate through; it shouldn't be this slow in a brand new computer. i'm sure other people won't mind it too much, but for me, it was a dealbreaker.",Still on the fence,2023-08-07,3.0

Whatever is playing will just be at a normal consistent volume and then seemingly randomly and unpredictably it'll cut to a lower volume and then stay there. And then if the audio playing gets really quiet and then loud again, it'll be at its original volume for like a millisecond before going back to the lower volume. This happens exclusively with the speaker, as in the headphones work just fine. I've turned off enhancements, changed every setting in the control panel sound settings, options sound settings, uninstalled and reinstalled drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled B&O. Nothing fixes the issue, and it's very noticeable. I sometimes forget the problem exists until I play any audio through the speakers (the volume fluctuating is that noticeable).~~... Okay, so I figured that out. I needed to go to ""device manager"" and instead of trying to update the audio driver by searching automatically for one, I had to instead search for one that came already downloaded on the computer. In this case, what fixed my problem, was setting the audio driver to the HD one, and then going back to the control panel speaker settings, and going to the enhancements tab (that wasn't present before to turn off all enhancements. This 100% fixed the stupid auto volume adjusting crap. (The default audio driver just sucks, not having much needed options.)- - Unlit keyboard with dark colored lettering so it's hard to see regardless, with heavy resistance - -Now I wouldn't mind a single one of these issues if that was the only one existing. But in this case, the keyboard does not have lit keys, has a letter coloring that blends in with the surrounding colors of the keys so even in a well lit room it's hard to make out what they keys are, and the keys themselves take quite some effort to press. Think of like a membrane keyboard, but just a little more resistant than that. Very clicky/noisy too. It doesn't feel great, but I could probably get used to it all.- - 6-bit color bit depth? - -I do notice that the colors on here look a bit off compared to any other display I use (phone and computer monitor). Then when I found that the display was set as a 6-bit color bit depth, I realized that this might be the reason why. After searching all around online to see if this was changeable, I've concluded that this is just part of the limitations of the monitor itself. Not the best, and definitely misleading with how this product is marketed.And then here are some non-issues that I've faced (as in things I've been frustrated with, but it's not that big of a deal).- It comes preloaded with Windows 11 (I just downloaded 10 and did a fresh reboot with that)- Battery life isn't the greatest, but I wasn't expecting much in that department- So much bloatware, but I guess that's more the fault of Microsoft than HP, since Windows 10 includes all kinds of useless crap (that I spent roughly 6 hours removing)Everything else has been great. If I can just get used to the keyboard (the placement of every key, and the ""weight"" of them), then this seems like a purchase generally worth $880. I'll just have to accept less than ideal color depth (it's not that bad tbf). I wouldn't mind spending a couple hundred more to fix these issues, and maybe have separate action keys that aren't the same as the function keys (since I use those quite often). I might consider that, but I really needed a laptop to work on DAW projects at school and just other things outside my room, which I know this will suffice for a good while.",Consider the downsides,2022-11-04,4.0,R1IJ9VEVHC7C66,AMAXAMA,0.0,Issues:Battery lasts about 1 hourNo lighted keyboard.Feedback:make all connections usb-cmake it sturdier and impact resistantadd touch screen,issues and feeback,2023-07-21,3.0

After receiving the laptop, I already had 32gb ram and a 1tb SSD waiting and immediately put those in. I did not even bother with the 8gb of ram that it came with. HUGE surprise when I opened it up and there was an additional slot for another m.2 SSD, where the os comes on the smaller 256gb SSD that it comes with.That being said, I connect to a 34' curved 1440p via type c to display adapter have had nothing but good gaming experience. I play hell let loose and insurgency on medium graphics and still average around 70 fps with no issues. The thermals have not even came above 80 degrees for either cpu or gpu and that was surprising considered it is an amd cpu.I also love the minimalistic design laptop which I would call a ""sleeper"". Ironically I sold my old ideapad 3 for this one and could not be happier. I use it mainly for school and programming and it is just awesome I can do some stunning gaming as well.The Lenovo controller/vantage is also great to make it more efficient for gaming and would totally recommend keeping it installed.Now, I have not tried gaming with call of duty of bf 2042, as I personally do not enjoy those games but Im sure it would run it no problem at proper settings.You do not need an insane computer to run these games, you just need one that is efficient and doesnt have a bottle neck.If you are looking to get into gaming, this would be the bare minimum laptop I would recommend.",Amazing Value Big Surprise!,2023-09-24,5.0,RGNHC4GZ7E7I7,KingZGShadow,33.0,"Ok to make this quick and sweet and since I'm not very good at making reviews I'll start with the good and then end with the issues at least I've experienced with mine in the past few days I've had it and been using it.The laptop is actually pretty good at playing about anything I throw at it even if it is over the specs like resident evil village at absolute maximum settings with ray tracing on with the laptop only on balanced mode. I still got about 30-50 frames even with the settings at max. It also can handle the new dead space remake quite well. the laptop is quite responsive as well and never really got too hot even when being stressed I rarely heard the fans kick up like my more expensive MSI ge66 raider. Now for the issues I've had with mine, when I first got mine I had a issue where playing videos weather it was in Microsoft edge/Chrome on YouTube or local videos it would cause the whole display to glitch in a glitchy pattern, flash to black like windows had crashed and then reopened everything, lock up the video playback at one frame with audio still playing then suddenly zoom the video to where it should be, or flicker between two frames with audio and time still going then suddenly zoom forward to where the video should be at. I did reinstall the Nvidia and AMD drivers but it still persisted which is where the second issue happened even though I think this was more to do with windows but the visual c++ 2015 - 2022 redistributable wouldn't install because I think there was a issue with visual c++ 2015 - 2019 redistributable not wanting to update or even letting me uninstall it like it didn't exist even though it was there. To fix that I had to reinstall windows 11 using windows reset with the option to keep my personal files selected where my 3rd issue came up but fixed itself I guess after a full system shutdown for hours. After the reset the Lenovo ACPI disappeared and so did the power modes and other parts of the Lenovo Vantage side bar options so I couldn't use quick charge or conservation mode even after manually installing the Lenovo ACPI it didn't come back or show in device manager only seeing the Microsoft ACPI. I even tried reinstalling Lenovo vantage and it's services but that didn't work. To fix that I uninstalled the Microsoft ACPI then installed the Lenovo ACPI then shut down my laptop for like 5-6 hours. After all that even though it still shows Microsoft ACPI in device manager the Lenovo vantage settings came back. The final issue which goes back to the video playback issue. I think I found the solution along with reinstalling the drivers you have to disable ""Use Hardware Acceleration When Available"" setting in chrome seems to have fixed that issue from what I know of as of making this review. But there's another issue from that which happened at least once when I turned that setting back on and watched a video as soon as I started up the video the feedback froze and then suddenly the whole display went completely black even the backlight and then my system suddenly restarted. In event viewer it said it was from Kernel-Power with event ID:41. Not exactly sure what to make of that but it appeared in the event viewer as a critical error at the same time the system crashed and restarted from the video.So in summery this laptop is great for everyday gaming if you're not expecting extreme power. It will get you by with the current specs if you want a budget entry level gaming laptop but there might be issues in some areas unless I got a little faulty system. I'm thinking the issues I've had with video playback are drivers causing problems I'll keep a eye on it and see if more problems come up while using it more.",Pretty powerful and decent at your basic every day gaming needs but may have a few issues.,2023-01-30,3.0

Link: [ SGIN 15.6 Inch Laptop, 24GB DDR4 512GB SSD Windows 11 Laptops Computer with Intel Celeron N5095 Processor ]  Now for my personal customer review of this laptop: It was shipped quickly, arrived nicely double-plus packed to guard against any possible careless handling.  That was the first impression, telling it had been packed by someone experienced in commercial shipping and definitely knows what they are doing.  After getting it out of all the packing and taking a look at it I read the operator's manual before even plugging it in to charge the battery.  The manual was simple, as it should have been.  When the battery was full, I activated the laptop and was impressed with its speed of starting, considering all of the security measures that Microsoft built into W-11.  It took me awhile to complete setup of the Microsoft-11 OpSys, because I am rather specific on what personal information I allow others to have or ""use"".  McAfee loaded quickly.  To simplify my review of this laptop computer:  If the very best review grade of any component or the operation of this computer is a ""five"", then every piece of this SGIN deserves at least a five, and for the RAM provided on a laptop it deserves a ""ten"".  I find absolutely no fault with it at all.  And just for information; I do have five nice desktops built by myself, three working laptops plus two other laptops I gave to family. All have Microsoft plus a secondary Linux Mint OpSys.  I just wanted to see if I would like Windows-11.

This is certainly a product that, on paper, appears to be a cost-effective solution for anyone not requiring high-intensity gaming capabilities. However, in practice, its performance, build quality, and overall user experience leave much to be desired.Let's start with performance, a key factor for any professional trying to get work done efficiently. Despite not needing the intensive processing power required for modern gaming, the ANMESC laptop still underperformed in basic tasks. Frequent lags, unpredictable system responses, and constant freezing were just some of the many frustrations I faced. Navigating even the simplest documents or web pages was a challenge, making it nearly impossible to maintain the level of productivity I need.Unboxing: The case felt flimsy, and I experienced several static shocks in drawing the laptop from the sleeve it was boxed in.While the idea of a cost-effective laptop that can handle everyday work tasks is appealing, the ANMESC laptop simply does not live up to these expectations. I found myself constantly irritated by its poor performance and cheap build quality, detracting from my focus on work and threatening peace of mind that is critical for online interactions with clients.In conclusion, I cannot recommend the ANMESC laptop. It promises much but delivers little, especially in a professional context. Even for those not requiring gaming capabilities, there are much better options out there that provide a balance of performance, quality, and cost. Always remember, investing in a reliable laptop is an investment in your professional image and productivity. It's worth paying a bit more for a device that truly serves your needs.",Frustrating and disappointing,2023-07-13,2.0

This means that the hottest part of the laptop has space for airflow and is generally not in contact with your legs, *not* dumping heat onto you if you are resting it there while sitting for example.And of course the laptop is extremely light and feels great to move around, very portable!On the negative side of things, for a $1300 laptop, the top of the device immediately attracts a lot of fingerprints. That might be a problem with any kind of shiny technology, but for something with such a high price tag, you might care about aesthetics like that (and I mean, the top of this device is so cool to look at, it is a shame the fingerprints tend to muddy that).I don't really have anything to say about the panel being OLED. But if you get this laptop, you might want to go into windows settings > display > brightness, and disable ""change brightness based on content."" It is a very annoying feature if you are swapping between tabs a lot (problem with Windows, not the laptop).Unit Specific Issues - Asus RMA Review:It may have just been my unit - and hardware defects happen all the time, manufacturing can't be perfect I suppose - but one of the fans on the laptop was making a strange buzzing sound when it would run. The normal sound the fan should make is a light high pitched whine, but this sounded more like a vibrating toothbrush. Anyway, I had just bought the laptop when I noticed this, so I immediately sent it to Asus for RMA.I heard scary stories online how ASUS's RMA process can be a nightmare, but I can jump to the end of the story and say that the laptop came back in one piece with the fan fixed as I had hoped. BUT, strangely the WIFI would not work. It would connect to the WIFI but it would not actually receive or send data. I tried to update drivers and all that, but the only thing that truly fixed it was reinstalling Windows 11 from scratch. My wild guess is that resetting the CMOS battery in the unit during RMA (which Asus said they did) caused some weird things to happen to the OS. I mean I could tell the OS got messed with because when I tried to ""reset"" Windows through the recovery tab in settings, I was getting errors.Either way, Asus claims in their RMA that your data may be wiped in the process of repairs, so the fact that I had to freshly reinstall Windows the old fashion way is just how it is I guess. Otherwise, the device is here now working as expected. Maybe I got lucky, or maybe people on the internet got unlucky, but my RMA experience was not that bad, and I got what I needed without catastrophic headaches. So, I will say if your unit has any defects just make sure you follow all the advice on their website and you should be okay.Mega Nerd Stuff:Last thing. If you are going to try and install Linux, or fresh install any OS for that matter you are going to run into driver problems (as of 8/27/2023). Most notably, the SSD that comes with this laptop for some reason is not recognized while installing the OS, so you will need to know and have access to the correct drivers BEFORE installing the OS. My assumption is that the hardware in this device is too new for current drivers to be pre-packaged into most Operating System installations. Either way good luck if you attempt this journey.",Asus RMA: Not So Bad,2023-08-28,4.0,RV73MG2H5AE3G,XPC,0.0,"We purchased this laptop for our business so that we could keep up our work while on the road to conferences and conventions. Unfortunately, the S 13 OLED Ultra is not up to the task. We can do very simple functions in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign such as arranging images and text or simple vectors. However, complex operations such as Photoshop actions or even applying multiple effects (like shadows, feathers, blurs, etc) in those same programs will bog this machine down or cause the programs to crash in the middle of your work. After Effects and Premiere Pro are right out. I tried to run a 30 second After Effects project with simple 3D motions, and the machine made a horrendous noise and shut down. It seems fine, but I won't dare open AE on it again. This computer will be relegated to word processing and playing 1080p videos on a small monitor at conventions. That's all it's good for. I'm only giving it a 3rd star because the product description does not ""specifically"" say it will work with AE or run complex operations in the other graphic design programs.

There is a slot on the bottom that can be opened in order to access something under it but  I did not try to open or upgrade the item as the specifications on this were pretty strong on stock alone. That being said you should do your research before purchasing this. Based on the current specification, I am sure you do not need to do any upgrades if you are using it for basic use. This is by no means a gaming laptop and cannot handle games as much. This laptop overall is an average size laptop. It is relatively thin but not surface book thin. The specification are not bad for what you get. This laptop is not too heavy and can fit in most laptop bags. It has a quad core celeron processor which is a very basic. The ram is 12 gb which is well over the standard 8 gb for most other lower end laptops. It will definitely work for most daily usage and a bit of heavy multitasking. That being said, it is okay in terms of battery life. It really only last about four  hours on average at most on a full charge. The cooling system is not too noisy on heavy usage. It is a standard charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future. The power brick is okay but it does take up the good amount of space if you happen to plug into a surge protector. Also it does not get hot during charging but do not leave it under a blanket or anything that can keep heat in. Upon boot up of the laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick with its 512 GB SSD. I am unsure if it is an SSD or M2 drive but it boots up pretty quick. The setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. You just need to make sure you have a microsoft account and such. It does run on windows 11 and I am unsure if you can do any downgrades if you like the other windows. The bloatware is not too terrible but I tend to remove those as much as possible. The laptop also has only a 15.6 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. This is a pretty standard laptop screen size. The screen has an okay brightness but not the best on the market. It still keep the traditional two 3.0 USB port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. The laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. The laptop surface where the wrist rest is where I do not like the material. It looks nice with the dark silver but with long term use it will fade over time. The keys are okay, but not the best. They do feel a bit cheap but they are responsive. It will work for me but I am unsure if the keys will fade over time. The external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so I would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. It is sealed inside a nice bag (not sure if it is antistatic) The trackpad runs pretty well, It is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. It also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. There is a camera that will record at at least 720p. You could put a web cam cover on it but it does have a switch on the side to turn the camera on and off which is interesting and unique to this laptop. The microphone is okay but you can hear a bit of choppiness to voice. It does pick up some surrounding noise. On laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. Depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually make this laptop last longer than 4 hours. Best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what I can tell. It is not too long. It has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but uninstall bloatware or whatever you do not need. The speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. Again this is not a gaming laptop as it does not have a powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer. The processor is a simple celeron laptop which is mostly for your daily use. The processing speed is decent and it works really well for say school work. There is an HDMI port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. I am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. Overall this laptop is a decent for a home use laptop. You get an average size screen but this is not a gaming laptop. It can handle some light games but nothing intense. The laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is okay. The specification is not bad at 12 GB ram and 512 gb SSD drive. The space is decent for what a student may need. It is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work or basic computer with a single monitor connection.

So far, it's proven itself to be pretty powerful with a high end CPU, and I also find the backlit keyboard to be a big help when it's dark.I can't comment on battery life since I haven't used it that much, but after calibrating the battery it usually estimates itself at 9+ hours at max charge, though I have it on a lower performance setting. Will come back to update after I toil in academia.Anyways, you've probably already seen the pictures connected to this review so the secret is out, but apparently this laptop has a secret 2nd M.2 Slot hidden next to the fans. Just disconnect the ribbon cable and peel the black tape away, and there it is. Perfectly functional too. I installed a 1TB Crucial P3 Plus with a thermal pad so the ribbon cable doesn't heat up, and after a restart I managed to initialize the new SSD and now have another TB of space in this thing.It's a little strange that they decided to hide away this slot and not say a word about it even though doing so would make it an even more appealing product, I only know of this because I stumbled upon a disassembly video of the laptop in question and someone brought it up in the comments.Anyways, the only reason I'm giving this laptop a 4 star review despite all of my praises is the fact that the 16 gigs of RAM are soldered to the laptop.

When I received the LT one of the first things I did is verify the specs. and actual LT hardware, then I checked out the warranty.  As it turns out Amazon consciously left out any mention of warranty (I assumed wrongly that this was simply a misnomer on Amazon's part, bad assumption).  As it turns out the warranty clock started when the LT was delivered to the retail distributor (not Amazon but a third party (busylittlebee)).  This means that there was only 4 months remaining on the warranty (originally 14 mo. warranty).  I was pissed!!!!!! According to Dell's records, this LT was sold to Best Buy, so I don't understand how ""busylittlebee"" became the distributor??  Anyway, Dell is a good company and I contacted them, sent them my Amazon Invoice and Dell extended my warranty from the date I purchased the LT to 12 months!!  Prior to contacting Dell about the warranty issue I contacted Amazon and Amazon's response was ""return it"" with an attitude.The LT includes 32GB of RAM which is just right when you have a LT with a touch screen.  The larger RAM helps make the touch screen perform better!  The huge SSD 1TB is overkill (in my opinion) but no harm.  I will not be using this LT for gaming so I did not rate it for this use, primarily being used for multirotor RC devices, recording Drum Covers, misc. other tasks.  Others have complained about the display brightness. I took it outside on a sunny day and tested it since this is the environment I will use it when flying my multirotor RC craft.  I found the display to be acceptable, readable in sunlight (although there is some glare from the touchscreen), but still the display is adequate when used in full sun outside.  The touch screen is very handy when Recording Drum Covers.  I use a high performance DT computer for most tasks.","A lot of Lap Top for the money, just watch out for Amazon not including a full warranty!",2023-04-25,5.0,R3QD383JFTZ0N3,Diana C.,6.0,"I have only had the laptop for about a week.

The main thing I'm unhappy about is regarding the battery. The battery, fully charged, only lasts about 2 hours. This is completely unacceptable. Secondly, while using the laptop, the bottom of the laptop gets extremely hot. So hot, in fact, that I have trouble using it if it is actually on my lap. It gets too hot for my legs. It makes me concerned about whether the cooling system is actually working. I don't plan to return at this point but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to others especially if the usage needs to be in transit.

I found a small, black wired USB mouse, a white charging adapter, a clear, washable keyboard protector and a short user manual.The laptop is thin and weighs below 4 pounds. It has four rubberized feet in each corner at the bottom side that slightly elevate it, so air can circulate beneath. The keyboard is red as well with white characters, has a keypad and many functions have to be called with the Fn button. However, it does have its own Volume control buttons. What I miss is lights for the keys. Yet, it has three indicator lights right above the keyboard on the left for Power On, Caps Lock and Num Lock.The touchpad is large and has a different tone of red. It makes a click sound when I press on it. It supports multThe 16 inch display has a resolution of 1920 00d71200. Its aspect ratio is 16:10, which is slightly wider than 16:9 but it 2019s a difference I can notice, especially when I 2019m working with office apps. I can tilt the screen up to 180 degrees. I find the colors are displayed accurately and lively. I can set the brightness with my keyboard or through the operating system.There are seven ports in total. On the right side are three ports: one USB 3.0, one headphone jack, on SD card slot. What I find curious is that there 2019s a small rectangular opening. I thought that would be another port but I couldn 2019t find any reference in the user manual. Yet, in the listing itself I could find a picture that labels it as lock but I could not find any more information on how to use that lock and what it actually locks. Maybe somebody can tell. Anyway, on the left side, there are four ports: again one USB 3.0, DC power, HDMI, and a type C USB port.On the bottom, I have quick access to the 512 GB SSD and HDD bay. With quick access I mean I don 2019t have to open up the whole laptop. I just have to unscrew to screws to remove the cover of the SSD; the same goes for the HDD bay.That said, I added a 2.5 inch 320 GB Seagate Hard Drive to the laptop and installed Debian 12 Bookworm. The installation of the second operating system went through without errors and I could boot into my new Linux OS in seconds. I encountered no hardware compatibility issues.By the way, secure boot was off by default and I haven 2019t changed anything in the BIOS which has been released by AMI on March 29, 2023.I also booted into the pre-installed OS, which is Windows 11. The first boot took long because I had to go through the first time setup and in the beginning, browsing wasn 2019t fast because Windows downloaded tons of updates. Yet, after the update, web browsing got back to normal.When I opened the task manager, I checked the performance tab and indeed, the laptop has 12 GB installed. However, what baffled me was that task manager listed open RAM slots. So, I opened up the command prompt and issued the following command: wmic memphysical get MaxCapacity. That told me the maximum RAM capacity the laptop can handle. I don 2019t remember the exact number but it was over 12 GB. So, I decided to open up the laptop to just find out there were no empty memory slots and the pre-installed memory is soldered together. In short, no way to add more RAM. Still, the RAM is decent enough for daily work. It 2019s 12 GB DDR4 SDRAM at 2400 Mhz.When I opened up the laptop, I could also see that it has a 38 watts battery. Fully charged, the battery lasts me slightly over six hours with a few applications open and viewing a few videos.The processor is an Intel Celeron Processor N5095 that was released in the first quarter of 2021 according to Intel 2019s website. I can do basic tasks like web browsing, email, office like powerpoint with it. It has four cores and can boost up to 2.9 GHz, which is enough power for most everyday tasks.When it comes to sound, the audio is ok as there are two speakers for stereo. However, I prefer to use my headset as I like to listen to songs at high volume. The built-in microphone captures sound clearly but I often end up using my headset 2019s mic but in either case, I can 2019t tell much difference. Recordings from both sound almost identical.The webcam 2019s resolution is ok but my face appears paler than in real life and movements show up slightly delayed. It 2019s also not compatible with Windows Hello 2019s face unlock feature. However, I don 2019t care as I will primarily use the laptop with Debian and rarely, if ever, use Windows.The laptop also has Bluetooth 4.2. I could pair it to my soundbar that I mainly use for my smart TV. I didn 2019t encounter any delays.I was able to connect my laptop to my home network using both 5G and 2.4G Wi-Fi. Even though it does not have an Ethernet port built-in, it instantly detected my USB-C hub with Ethernet. This is important to me because I use the laptop as a private Pi-hole DNS server. A Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that blocks ads on all devices on my home network.A wired connection is important for a Pi-hole DNS server because it provides a more reliable and faster connection than Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi connections can be unreliable, especially in a crowded area or if there is interference from other devices. A wired connection is less likely to be interrupted, which means that my Pi-hole DNS server will be able to block ads more consistently. In addition, a wired connection can provide a faster connection, which is important for a Pi-hole DNS server because it needs to be able to quickly respond to DNS requests. If my Pi-hole DNS server is not able to respond quickly, then I may experience delays when loading websites.In addition to being more reliable and faster, a wired connection also uses less power than Wi-Fi. This is important because my laptop is now running a Pi-hole DNS server, which requires more resources than a normal laptop. By using a wired connection, I can save power and extend the battery life of my laptop.I have configured my Debian OS so that my laptop never turns off automatically. If it runs on battery due to a power outage, I have it set to turn off when the battery level reaches 5%. Furthermore, my laptop now boots directly into shell, no GUI at all. This saves even more resources.However, in case I need to use my laptop for work, I can quickly switch back to Debian's graphical interface. The Pi-hole DNS server can keep working while I'm using the laptop as with 12 GB RAM, it's more than enough to prevent it from running out of memory.","Fully compatible with Linux, serves as Pi-hole DNS server and backup PC",2023-08-11,5.0,R3SGZ43H7RARYO,latoya,0.0,NO KEYBOARD LIGHT,No KEYBOARD LIGHT ONLY BAD THING,2023-07-30,3.0

I absolutely hunt and grind when im looking for a product to buy and i will look at every single aspect of a device before i make a decision.1. screen quality:the screen is relatively bright and indoors i have no real issues with glare. the resolution is high enough that i dont feel a need for more. no dead pixels but i will say color is NOT a strong point for this laptop. im not a content creator and even i feel the transition from my desktop to this laptop jarring when it comes to colors. the default wallpaper makes it look god but even on the vivid preset, it is quite washed out. nout a deal breaker but not color accurate by any means.2. Battery life:so i havnt reach the full extent of the battery because i immediatly enabled the battery life saver that stops charging at 80% and i consider 30% to be dead so right away i lose 50% of max battery and still i get about 3 and a half hours with typical school use which is browser tabs with max brightness so pretty solid. it charges quickly with the included 90 watt charger and even my aftermarket 65 watt charger charges it form 30 to 80% in 1 hours while using it.3. Performance:Performance has been great so far. i havnt pushed it to its absolute max but it can handle light gaming and even modern games if you crank the settings down. the heat that comes out on heavy use is intense but under light use the fan doesnt even kick on so it stays cool and silent in most use cases.4. keyboard:Keyboard is good enough for what it is. this entire review was typed on the laptop without too many issues. the backlight is busted by default, there is a setting in the included asus software that fixes the backlight not changing with the function key. under customization, input device settings set function key lock to normal function key uses and it will work as expected.5. Upgrades:so far i have upgrades the ram to 24gb with a single 16gb stick and a swapped the included wifi card with an intel one and that helped with the slow connection to wifi on startup. the would be about a 30 second delay after boot where there would be no internet. the ssd can be swapped with a larger 2210 but the 512gb is enough for me and its plenty fast. very easy to open and clean.conclusion:i absolutely love this laptop. ive never owned a relatively modern laptop and this is an amazing first start. i hope it holds up for many years to come",A Very Great Laptop,2023-07-17,5.0,RC3EM9PXQUP3I,Kaylee Kelsey,0.0,"I've never had this advanced of a computer before- the last Windows I had was a Windows 7, so this is by far an upgrade.The only reason I purchased this was for my college classes that required a system that supported Adobe Illustrator and InDesign. Good thing is, this computer does.The first problem I encountered with this was the UPDATES. There was so many, it just STOPPED UPDATING. I troubledshooted about ten times before I made the decision to reinstall Windows 11 by resetting it. It kept all my information and updated everything that it needed to. Since then, it runs well, and is out of my league of tech intelligence. The touch screen is so convient, the finger print is instant, and the key pad is nice. As a previous Chromebook user, it is much more touchy and is an adjustment for sure.The fan is loud when it is opening large apps and is running a certain amount of things at a time, so don't be surprised by that. The flip and hinges are much more stable than I expected. It was the first thing I tested and it was definitely sturdy. I am no expert, but the audio is alright. I have not tested the Bluetooth, but I do know the audio from it seems muffled. Then again, that might just be me not being used to the advancements.THE BATTERY--- is questionable. After an hour and a half I sit at almost 55%. That to me is concerning. I have a Chromebook that will sit at 89/90% after that long. Long lasting might be a bit of an overstatement.  However-, if it is in sleep, it keeps a good charge. Running anything for a period of time seems to be a killer.So far it is doing what it needs to do, and is nice. For the price, I wouldn't say it's reasonable. I know tech has issues, but the hours-long fight I had with this thing was ridiculous and not worth almost $700. But, for being on the cheaper side for something of its nature, it's good for it's use.SIDE NOTE: I highly recommend anyone switching from chrome or anything that isn't Microsoft to get a Microsoft account before purchasing. Yes, basic knowledge, but having that all set before having the product will be much easier. I luckily was able to use my old account from when I had my Windows 7.",Nice but Debatable for Price,2023-09-04,3.0

It seems with all the things coming up 32 might be necessary to run all we like to do  Cannot add more Ram, can add/upgrade the hard drive.Very QuietKeys fabulousTouchpad -- large but really nice (and I hate touchpads ... I use my Wacom Graphics Tablet. )Battery respectable; however, it depends on if you use 120 hz or 60 hz, and what all you are doing.  It can last a long time for normal texting and surfing etc., but if working, it goes fairly fast.  You therefore need to keep a charging port open to use to charge.  With no separate battery, it uses the connections leaving you with what is left for your devices  Then you have left a C and a USB 3.2, HDMI.  I don't use HDMI but might for a second display, but with my Wacom needing usb 3.2, my 2 external hard drives also need one 3.2 and one C.  I work on graphics, photos, etc., all day, and need those back ups.  For me it is critical to get the Anker Prime 6-in-1 USB C Charging Station, 140W Compact Power Strip for Work and Travel, 5 ft Detachable Extension Cord with 6 Ports, to give me some additional ports and make my workflow more comfortable as well as everything else or something like it.

This laptop is a really great investment.By the way, it has a back lit keyboard, no touchscreen (I did not use anyway).  Feels sturdy, I just wish it had more ports and a longer battery life.  Came with 60W charger and cord.  Amoled screen.  Fingerprint scanner on power button which since I am using at home  I bypassed using it.

Very basic and speedy, yet does everything I really need.CONS:- My old MacBook Air spoiled me with consistently giving me 8-9 hours of use on a single charge. I haven't tested it extensively, but Samsung Chromebook XE521 has been giving me about 5 hours of medium use. It's not terrible, but is a pretty big drop off from what I am used to having.- I have also noticed apps and processes run a tiny bit slower than my old MacBook with the Core i5. Still completely adequate for basic apps and web-based work.- I found the reviews about the hinge breaking AFTER purchasing. The possibility of cracking the screen just by opening the lid worried me enough that I purchased a two year, $57 protection plan from Asurion. Now I have the peace of mind that even if my unit does break, I will have it covered. I will say the left hing feels especially stiff when opening and closing. To see if I could make it a little more smooth, I applied a few drops of very light gun oil to the hinge assembly. I didn't remove the case or anything, so I was just counting on the oil penetrating to the moving parts. I don't think it made too much of a difference, but maybe just enough to prevent the hinge from seizing up and breaking the screen? I plan to add a few tiny drops of oil every month or so (if I remember).Four stars. Would definitely be five stars if the battery life and processing speed was a bit more impressive and there were no catastrophic hinge issues potentially looming on the horizon.","Excellent Form Factor, A Pleasure to Use, A Little Underpowered",2021-04-28,4.0,R105T6I32Y2U8Q,Dee,0.0,"I bought used so I accept there will be some imperfections.

I'd like to build another desktop, but want to drop that kind of money until DDR6 is a thing instead of building it in the middle of the DDR5 Lifecycle.  That's still a few years out.So this was a great purchase for my needs.  It is literally desktop performance in a laptop at a mid-range price.Let's start with the cons and why I don't careThe display isn't the best.  Don't get me wrong, its great, but not anything special.  That doesn't bother me, because its connected to my 4k monitor.  Who cares about laptop screens anyway.  4k resolution doesn't make much of a functional difference on a small screen.  Costs were cut there for sure.  Costs were probably also cut on the battery.  It doesn't last long not plugged in on normal loads, and its probably not even feasible to use it unplugged while gaming.  This would suck if I planned to use it unplugged, but again, this matters not to me.  There is also a technology implemented called CoolerBoost 5.  Its pretty necessary to run when gaming newer games at max settings.  It gets PlayStation loud.  If you're an audiophile, then you're going to need some good noise-canceling headphones to really enjoy anything on this machine.  This doesn't bother me, because I'm not an audiophile, and even if I was, I have a couple great sets of noise-canceling headphones.  It also doesn't bother me because without it, all of the great things about this thing wouldn't mean squat.... let me explain...Now for the Pro'sThis thing runs great without load on balanced power settings (No CoolerBoost).  Without CoolerBoost, its about as quiet as it comes.  I only use it for browsing and playing music outside of gaming.  It does great.  I haven't tried watching any 4k videos on it yet, but I imagine it would handle that well on balanced power settings as well.Remember when I mentioned the noise level from the CoolerBoost 5 as a con.  Well, Coolerboost is probably just as important of a feature as any of the hardware this machine packs.  Gaming laptops get a bad rep, mostly because they literally burn up a lot faster than a desktop and are difficult and expensive to fix when they do.  The reason being is inadequate cooling.  This is a tiny box to fit all of those extreme heat producing components in.  Getting desktop-like cpu temps and gpu temps in a laptop should be a pipedream.  Seeing temps in the 85-90 degree Celsius range or higher is just part of the territory.  With CoolerBoost on, this thing hangs in the 60-75 degree range with BG3 running max settings.  That's as good or better than my desktop. Have you heard of temp-throttling?  Yeah, that's only a thing if you let it be a thing with this machine.  That said, without CoolerBoost active while running BG3 at max settings, I watch those temps move to the Upper 80s and low 90s, like one would expect with this kind of hardware in such a small box.  It is well worth the noise to have a machine packing an i7 13th gen chip and RTX 4070 gpu that can sport desktop temps while actually using the hardware at its potential.Final ThoughtsThis machine is fantastic if you're looking to replace a desktop with a laptop that will likely last.  All of the right corners have been cut.  Due to the temps sitting at desktop level, I anticipate the hardware components to potentially last indefinitely.  This will still be a very serviceable and more portable machine when I do get my desktop built.  The potential issues I see are needing to replace fans at some point due to the CoolerBoost.  They could also last too, its just a possible logical consequence of running the fans at high RPMS.  I imagine the most important fix that I'll run across is replacing the battery.  Those things will always go bad eventually, but more quickly if there are periods of high humidity in your gaming area.  Think about spring or fall days where the AC isn't running.  Years of that will kill a battery.",Desktop performance in a laptop,2023-08-11,5.0,R30MGPV18MFL7A,Nicholas Evans,2.0,"Honestly, this laptop is pretty good.  I did upgrade the ram and added another m.2 drive (hardware not included...really?) If you contact support they will give you the hardware plus a thermal pad, make sure when you are putting the m.2 in that the thermal pads are on the top of the m.2 and not on the bottom. Then remove the protective film from the bottom chassis of the laptop.Some complaints I have, this may be a personal preference though.  The charging port on the left side really doesn't work for me.  I feel that the charger is always laying on top of your feet or laptop.  The charging port is also quite loose as well.  The other thing is, is the FN keys are to the left why are you putting FN command key on the right?  The volume control buttons could also be FN and the arow keys instead of it being F3.  I use the volume control more often than fan control and a crosshair for FPS games.Other than that, it is a good laptop.",It's a good laptop but...,2023-08-13,3.0

However, I have never really been fully satisfied with a laptop I have owned in my life and there have been quite a few. This laptop is not perfect by any means, but, of all the others I have owned it is by far the best one. Because of that I definitely think 5 stars are justified even though I will list some minor complaints below.Some positive qualities:- Screen quality: The screen is amazing. I'm a big fan of OLEDs but this display is very satisfying for a laptop. The dual mode is very convenient as well - for more demanding games I do find myself switching modes. It is worth the reboot. The 240Hz refresh rate makes me spend a lot of time in the lower resolution mode as well.- Build quality: This laptop feels like one of the most solid Windows laptops I have ever owned. Being aluminum I was picturing a solid old macbook like stiffness, but it definitely isn't that thick which is a bit sad. However, I got over it pretty fast because this thing looks and feels great to handle.- Software: The setup experience was one of the most refreshing of any laptop I have purchased. No bloat. I didn't have to spend a half hour uninstalling crap from the manufacturer. There weren't 10 different applications I needed to use to change settings. I am also able to do things like switch to only using the dedicated GPU and not even using the integrated graphics, an experience I have never had the joy of being given compared to the big manufacturers that lock you out of things like that.- Charger: I am used to having big bulky chargers with all of my powerful laptops, but this charger is definitely the smallest of the bunch. I also really am a fan of the power connector and how solidly it connects to the laptop body.- Looks: I just wanted to put a specific section here to say this laptop finally satisfied my desire for a true dual use laptop - work and play on the road. The laptop does look super professional. No over the top RGB - no crazy gaming graphics. Just one logo and a light up keyboard which can be disabled (but I felt no need to - it isn't over the top in normal usage).- Low power charge support: This laptop handles being charged on lower output USB C chargers like a champ. No other power hungry laptop I have tried lets me plug into a 60W USB C wall charger and actually report some charging capability when demand is low. The system will charge when sleeping or powered off without issue with any charger I've tried it with.Some general thoughts:- Heat management: I've had laptops with louder fans, and I've had laptops that ran cooler, but to me this is a solid performer in terms of heat management. I've never felt the laptop was too hot sitting on my lap. When gaming on a table I also never have felt I was going to burn a hole in the table as with some gaming laptops in my past.- Touchpad: At first, I was extremely annoyed by the touch pad. I was constantly randomly scrolling or selecting or dragging things, sometimes even just by dirt or a piece of hair being on the touchpad. But I turned the sensitivity down in the windows settings menu and this all went away. I also turned off the 3/4 finger gestures since I don't use them - so that may have helped as well. If you really enjoy those this could be an issue. But, overall I am positive on the touchpad. I don't mind the size and enjoy the feel of the clicks and performance of scrolling and tapping.- Performance: For non gaming performance, I have been super impressed. It tears away at any work I throw at it. In terms of gaming performance, it is also pretty good. But I really have only casually gamed on this laptop. In Halo Infinite I get about 150FPS in High graphics modes with the screen not in 4K mode. Plenty to keep me satisfied, but maybe I should have just sprung for the 4080 to bump it up a big more in 4K mode.- Battery life: Battery life is pretty good. Far better than my past gaming laptops. But there is one minor annoyance I have and that is that Windows won't accurately estimate battery life. The battery will be at 80% and Windows will say ""5 minutes remaining"" of battery life. I don't know if that's Microsoft's fault or something with the Razer drives/BIOS, but it is there regardless.- Weight: This is the heaviest laptop I have owned so far. But I don't care - it feels solid in a good way. But I wanted to mention it since that is important to some people.Some negatives:- Screen backlight uniformity: On the bottom of the screen I have three noticeable spots where the backlight is not uniform. But, these are only visible when the screen is completely black. I have never noticed it watching videos or gaming on the display - only when the laptop reboots or is changing power states. It bugs me knowing those spots are there at this price point - but once again they don't affect anything during usage. So annoying but not a huge deal.- Fan placement: If you pick up the laptop in the right place (which I seem to do 70% of the time), you will be grabbing right under the fan grille and actually stop the fan from spinning since the grille flexes inwards. The noise is a bit alarming and I feel it probably isn't great for the fans. Yes, eventually I am sure I will get used to picking it up ""the right way"" but I have never had to worry about this before with a laptop. And somehow I almost always pick it up and do this unless I am specifically thinking ""I must be very careful picking my laptop up off the table""So, overall, I am super happy. This laptop isn't perfect - but I don't think for me a perfect laptop exists. With that being said this is the best laptop I have owned and I will definitely stay in this line of laptops for the future if they still appear to be similar quality when it comes time for an upgrade!",My favorite laptop so far!,2023-05-16,5.0,R1UKB5AWWRQQHK,AH,7.0,"EDIT 7/9/23: I got yet another Blade 16 replacement after I returned the one with a defective GPU.

This listing contains many very different HP laptops. I got the model with 8 GB DDR4 RAM and 256 GB storage.)I've had this laptop for about a year now, and there have been no major issues besides ones that come from Windows itself or custom hardware upgrades (I upgraded the RAM and SSD, and had issues properly cloning the drive, but that was ultimately my fault). You're getting the performance of a very nice ~$500 laptop, so make sure you get this while it's on sale (which seems to be most of the time... $450 as of this review, $60 dollars less than I bought it at).For casual use:Great! The IPS screen looks great for videos and movies, and the CPU is more than capable enough to run Office tools and whatever other software you may need. It never really seems sluggish, and the battery has a reasonable amount of juice. The keycaps are a bit jiggly, and there's no backlight for usage in the dark, and the power button is just.... really thin, but it's otherwise fairly comfortable to use. No issues with the touchpad, although I wish they'd bring back separate click buttons... Good amount of ports, too.For gaming:Although I was expecting its performance to fall short, it's honestly better than I expected. Minecraft, Roblox, and other various lightweight games run well. The great IPS screen makes gaming feasible as well. If I ever decide to game while I'm not at my PC, I have options. Don't go expecting to play Fortnite or basically any other resource-intensive game on this, though.Technical stuff:This laptop came with 2 sticks of 4 GB DDR4 3200 MHz RAM, filling both slots available. I'm... really not sure why they did it this way instead of putting 1 stick of 8. That makes upgrading so much easier...It also came with a Kioxia 256 GB TLC (I assume based on their other listings) M.2 SSD with decent read/write speed. To replace those parts, you need to pry the rubber feet off the bottom to expose the screws holding the backplate on... that's really the worst part of the process though.If you're using it casually, you likely won't need to upgrade the RAM or storage, but it's getting cheaper and cheaper to do so by the day. I got a 16 GB RAM replacement (one stick; I put it alongside one of the 4 GB sticks for 20 GB total, I don't care about dual channel) and 2 TB storage replacement for under $100 total.","Could be better for price, but isn't bad.",2023-07-13,4.0,R2F65CT7HEK6FR,Chubb,9.0,"We bought this computer to replace one that was ""irredeemable"".

The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the 4 year extended warranty, which, I was told, included tech support.  We had a lot of problems with the last laptop, and needed tech support which was only good for one year.  (By the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft ""updated"" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working.  I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they ""updated"" my computer, and asked if they would fix it.  They said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge.  At that point I was loud and angry.  I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware.  ""You screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it"".  I said I would not pay such ransom ware money.  I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one.  I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing.  They did, and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the ""automatic update button"".  I did just that and for 4 years I loved my computer again.)

I have asked for a full refund, and am awaiting their answer.  If I don't receive my money then I will contact Amazon and ask them for the remainder off my refund.

Purchasing for the Switch has some pros and cons, Handheld, take the experience with you anywhere or dock your system for the big screen. as far as controls, I've always been a mouse and keyboard advocate. That being said I don't mind using a controller for games. Really depends on the game and genre of games. I didn't expect much for controls but if your wanting to play hard core competitivly you might find it a bit annoying. Instead of just closing doors with buttons you have to slowly look side to side then select the door button. I think FNFAF: Help Wanted had the same problem for me. On the bright side it could just me being extreamly particular. I just like the fast quick access for when I was on the PC I was like Sonic on speed clicking/switching extremely fast.Besides the controls and your preference on them, you will enjoy the experience wether your a returning player or better yet, starting for the first time. I almost made it sound like the game was difficult to play with the controls. It's not if you get good enough to predict the animatronics locations.Like I said for the price it's worth a buy. If you you have a PC however, I recommend getting it for that or hell, get it for both. The game isn't demanding at all. I think any PC no matter how old can run the game as long as you aren't on a super old operating system.Hope my review helps. Have fun!",Just as I Remembered!

The buttons on top of the controllers help to navigate the menu. Be patient with the loading because it takes maybe 4-5 minutes for it to load all the games and there are a lot.Audio/Picture Quality: On a few of them the audio and picture quality is a little bit distorted and the controllers lag a bit but that should be expected when converting 80's and 90's system games to fit our flat screens.Other Game Features: I love the fact that you can save your game progress and play later.

If you grew up playing Nintendo and remember those ""64-in-1"" or similar game cartridges, this is similar to that. The game selection has some definite classics. Games such as SMB1, SMB2, SMB3, Goonies (the first one), Elevator Action, Contra, and so many more. Just as with those old ""in-1"" cartridges, there will be duplicates and those that have variants of the same game. There are some annoying things. When the handheld is turned on, it blares this music at medium volume. So be ready to press the volume down button on the side right away. The device starts up with language choices, it defaults to ""CHINESE"" as the first language (Spanish and English are the other two). Unfortunately there is no way to change this default. I like the form factor of the handheld. It is small, pocket-sized, and easy to recharge with standard micro USB. The buttons are decent. I haven't used the included controller, so I can't tell you much about that. The same goes with the RCA TV connection, I don't really have much interest in using it at home but instead will continue to enjoy it on the go.",Great Price for a Little Portable Retro Handheld Gaming Device - Can't be beat.,2023-05-10,4.0,R3PQHIRZ2Z73XX,Ruffian,0.0,"This little game device is cute and loads of fun. There aren't many settings to adjust, and it resets each time you turn it off. It's a nice way to pass the time. It has a separate gamepad, but that doesn't work for me. I've tried all sorts of combinations, but it never works. The instructions merely warn not to take the thing apart, which is fine. There isn't a whole lot to this. It works fine when connected to a TV, but the gamepad still doesn't work.Charging is simple with a micro-USB (also the gamepad's port). But there's no on-screen battery monitor. I won't be playing this for hours to exhaust the battery. I haven't scrolled through the entire list to see what the 666 games are. The instructions don't have a list, and there's no way to page through them quicker than holding the down button.The gameplay is fine. The direction pad is effective, as are the buttons. This lil thing is loud, though. Every reset literally resets the device, so the volume returns to the max level. There's no way to be discreet with this. It does not have a headphone jack, and I doubt using an adapter would work because the device screen went black when using the composite cord to connect to the TV.",Pocket-sized Nostalgia,2023-03-17,3.0

Fr. (RevRev) Rick,0.0,"Game of Thrones Blu-ray setI purchased this set to replace my Season 1-6 and Season 7 and Season 8 DVD sets. In what follows please accept my apology if I have recalled something incorrectly. I found the set excellent and worth the price of admission, but I 2019d like to describe some  201cinteresting 201d features of the set.Realize that it is a huge set that includes 33 discs. When my set arrived I found that at least one-third (yes, about a dozen) of the discs were loose in their cases. I don 2019t know if this occurrence is a comment on the less secure Blu-ray cases (to me, they seem less so than DVD cases), a poor packaging for shipping job, or unusually rough handling during shipping. One corner of the slipcase cover was slightly  201caccordioned 201d but not very noticeable. All discs looked fine on inspection and all episodes (I viewed them all) plus all features (that I have viewed this far) have played without error.Obviously the video and audio quality far exceeds the DVD set that I have and that alone (plus having all eight seasons in one enclosed package) was worth the purchase. But read on, if you wish 2026The weirwood tree animation at boot up of each disc is cute though it sometimes doesn 2019t get a chance to actually animate each time (your mileage may vary depending on your equipment.) But the momentary static  201clanguages available 201d image at the start of each disc seems a bit unnecessary and maybe even a little irritating, but perhaps some may need it.Drop down  201chouse banner 201d menus are neat but they are translucent and so is the text on them so they are not easy to read over the moving video montage that is presented behind them. Also, not a big deal, but they retract after 60 seconds if not acted upon. Of course, you can open a banner again, but don 2019t be surprised if it disappears after you return from grabbing refreshment.All the original DVD extra bonus features provided are present along with several new features. Most are indeed  201cbehind the scenes 201d video features, but some are text and still animation images, some are voiced-over by the characters (not sure these were provided by the actors or not) and some are just text you walk through and read. Nice extras but not as good as the bonus video features provided.The extra 3-disc bonus set is excellent with a two-part  201cGame of Thrones Reunion 201d feature, Anatomy of a Scene 201d (for Seasons 4,5,6,7),  201cBehind the Scenes 201d (for Seasons 1, 2, 4, 5),  201cInside the Visual Effects 201d (for Seasons 1-7) and  201cSeason 7 Deleted Scenes 201d. There are similar features scattered throughout the sets and I have not viewed them all 2026yet.The  201cConquest & Rebellion 201d feature on disc 3 of the Bonus Features set is long (ten chapters) and yet quite interesting, though consisting of slightly animation-enhanced high quality static images and character voice-overs. (Again, perhaps not done by the actors.) Note that once you select a chapter the history continues to play through the following chapters unless you interrupt it (that is, you can 2019t play  201cone and done 201d.) I found it useful to have subtitles on during the feature. It gives a fairly thorough overview of the 300-400 years of history before the Game of Thrones timeline began.Starting with Season 4 and after  201cDolby Atmos 201d audio support is available, although I don 2019t have the equipment to determine the difference. But the enhanced audio is certainly available. The Bonus Features set does not support Dolby Atmos (who cares?)The ability to walk through the Episodes menu and select any episode from the entire season then be prompted to insert the correct disk if the selected episode is not on the current one is a nice little feature. It is not available on the Season 7 and 8 sets for some reason.I am sure you will enjoy this entire Blu-ray set of Game of Thrones!",Impressive Blu-ray set with MANY bonus features!,2023-09-18,5.0,R3N16PU1IXFGQC,Saint Nicolas Cage,70.0,"First of all, I won't be wasting anyone's time complaining about season 8 (which I haven't even seen yet), or anything else.  This is just a review of the 4K box set.I never got to watch a good deal of GoT, so pretty much everything is going to be new for me!  I only got to see the episodes on my PC, where I was lucky if the videos reached 480p.  I gave up after season one because it just wasn't enjoyable watching them like that.  So when I got my PS5, upgraded my receiver and added Atmos speakers, I started looking into 4K Blu-rays.  Thanks to Films At Home's review on YouTube, I discovered this and I just HAD to have it!The 4K picture quality is phenomenal.  With so much happening in the snow and in the dark, watching this with HDR will blow your mind away!  The Atmos tracks are a very good addition, but not overly impressive (at least not yet, as I'm still in season one), and are still a part of an already an amazing presentation.  The box artwork is great, and the slipcover has an embossed dragon wrapping around the side.Each disc has commentaries, but I've heard some have more than that, and there are 3 bonus Blu-rays of separate special features.  It also includes a code for the digital edition, which expires on December 31st, 2022.  Others here say that theirs had already expired last year, so maybe they've updated it.  Just make sure you realize that the digital copy is only in 1080p, not 4K.  There's also a small booklet with a list of the episodes from each season, and a bit of nice artwork.However, there is one major problem with the set, that I can't believe the designers got away with.  Most seasons each have four discs, but instead of having a swinging tray in the middle, they stacked two discs on top of one another on each side.  Everyone knows that doing this is a HUGE no-no, as it results in discs being damaged, especially when trying to remove them from the spindles.  I highly recommend getting a CD/DVD wallet to put them in right away.  Another problem is that the audio doesn't default to Atmos, even if you have it enabled on your receiver.  You need to go into the audio settings on each disc every time you want to watch one, and switch the playback to Atmos.  Not a huge deal, but it is a little annoying since I don't always think to do that.  Or maybe that's the way it is for everything with Atmos....I'm still fairly new to this.Another problem with the discs I just noticed after putting them into a wallet is how they're labeled.  They're black, with VERY small & dark copper text.  You basically have to hold them up to the light in order to see them.  Not a huge problem, but very bad design.Fortunately, I've learned from past bad experiences with a few box sets that you absolutely must check every disc, not just for scratches or duplicates, but also to make sure they actually can play.  You need to make sure that they can reach the main menu, and maybe even try playing a few seconds of an episode.  It's very time consuming to sit in front of the TV, swapping discs in and out for almost two hours, but it's worth it.  I'm saying all of this because I had to return my first order, as the third disc of season six didn't read at all.  I never would've found that out until after the return period.  From what I've read here, this seems to be a somewhat common problem with this set.  Also, season five's case was smashed on the top right, but those discs were fine.When I got my replacement, I immediately noticed that season one's box doesn't lock at all, and the sheet with the digital code wasn't secured in place like before.  It was loose and bent.  I can't be sure, because I have no need to redeem it, but I have a feeling that someone pulled a fast one and already did.  Also, the first discs of seasons three and four take a very long time to load, but in the end they do work, so I'll be keeping this set since everything else plays fine.All in all, if you're a GoT fan with a 4K Blu-ray player, there's no reason not to get this!  Yes, it's a bit pricey, but it's worth it.  Just don't forget to check the discs.",4K COMPLETE COLLECTION BOX SET REVIEW (NOT EPISODES).,2021-02-13,3.0

It'll play millions of classic games or just about anything you can find a rom for, up to PS1. It does come with a TF card preloaded with some games, and although I do question the legitimacy of this practice, it's worth it just to have a fresh TF card that's already formatted and organized.The buttons feel great, membrane-style as opposed to tactile, but feel great and aren't spongey at all. D-pad is nice and stiff, and the analog stick feels similar to a Switch. The build quality is overall fantastic, the metal shell adds a weighty feel to the unit and feels extremely satisfying to hold. There are volume buttons on the side, but the volume range isn't great. Two notches equal too loud and too soft.There's only two real issues with the hardware that aren't exactly oversights, but something you need to be aware of. There are two TF card slots, the second slot is covered by a sticker and contains the operating system. If you don't plan on loading a new operating system, do NOT remove this card. Without a properly formatted card containing an operating system, the unit will not turn on. If you attempt alternate operating systems, make sure you save the factory TF card and use a new one, just in case anything goes wrong.Second is the charging situation. There's a type c charge cable in the box, but the unit is sensitive to any kind of rapid or fast charging wall adapters (i.e. adapters that come with most phones). You need to make sure you aren't using anything too powerful to charge or else you risk frying the battery. The safest bet would be to use either a computer to charge, or an early 1 amp iPhone power adapter, just something weak. There are 2 type c inputs on the top of the unit but only the one on the left is for charging, the right is for accessories only. So PLEASE make sure you're using the correct port, I've heard reports of the system bricking from using the wrong port to charge.",Absolute Blast,2022-06-23,4.0,R265ZJ76HG21ZE,ZeldaN64Fan,4.0,"As far as how this device feels, the build quality is amazing.

Sound is good and battery life is fine. Here's the rub and the reason for a 2-star reduction: per the picture above, the play/advance button is RIGHT next to the lower left pad. So unless your small child has the coordination of Baryshnikov (and mine sure don't) the game will end right in the middle of it because their foot will inevitably stray 1 inch off the pad. It's really frustrating. Why wouldn't the mode button be on the speaker at the top? As such it's really of little use to us outside of piano mode, where it's not a huge deal if it advances to the next mode. You just cycle back to piano mode. Too bad; this could be a great toy. Suggestion for next edition as well: how about adding a different instrument for each pad? Just a suggestion, as my kids love doing that at the Imagination play area at Ecpot.","cool modes, good sound; terrible design flaw for start/advance button placement",2022-12-28,3.0

Works amazingly. Some games work better on Android, some work better on JELOS, and honestly, I even often use the stock FW for tough games that require a lot of load/save states because I find the hotkeys easier. The device itself is well made and super cute. Good battery, great screen, classic membrane mush feel. Couldn't be happier for the very reasonable price.As others have said, back up your firmware and flash a better SD Card. Plus, you'll need to supply your own games unless you buy this thing from another source. I chose Amazon because of easy returns just in case and the games that came with my 353p are wanting. So I had to supply my own. NES, SNES, and PS1 really shine, while GB, GBC, GBA seem as good. N64 is notoriously difficult to emulate but it honestly plays almost perfectly here, especially on Android. Perfectionists will always squirm but I'm 43 and remember the old hardware not always running perfectly either so whatever. 3DO was a nice surprise. Works flawlessly. Haven't tried much DS, GG, Saturn, or Dreamcast but plenty of videos detail it.Can't believe this thing isn't higher rated. For those of you who are afraid of the learning curve, I installed JELOS myself by following online tutorials and had zero problems. I'm not that much of a computer guy, either. It's really not as hard as you're thinking. If anything, the biggest challenge is sourcing roms and even that's pretty easy, especially with all the tutorials out there.

I still have yet to figure out why my added playstation 1 games are not showing up when every other game does. This device really shines when it comes to NES, SNES and Sega Master/Mega systems. Do not buy this for N64 or PlayStation. Though some N64 games play well, most do not. If you want a device to play 16bit games or lower then this is a great system to have in your pocket.",Great emulator but you will not find some of the bigger games,2023-06-16,3.0

It doesn't feel like a burden to read 2+ chapters in a sitting, even for the most hyperactive of children. However, that's the major drawback as well. I do not feel the reading is enough of a challenge. My little one flew through these, remembered little past the first day or so of reading them, and did not develop any skills or even patience.A parent can mitigate these problems somewhat. I started asking my little to tell me what he read after he read it, and his summaries of the chapters were often very funny and a great way to get him thinking about the characters and plots. I also started asking him to spend more time reading in a sitting, since the chapters were so short. I found that by the last book, he could easily read half the novel in one sitting in his favorite chair before getting antsy again.The boxed set is quite colorful and looks good on a child's shelf. It comes with an envelope sealed with a sticker, to be opened only after finishing the final novel. This has a QR code leading to a web announcement video for another novel series, and some bonus material. This gimmick really got my little one into reading to the end, and he was excited to open the envelope. So excited, in fact, that I went and purchased the new series' boxed set right after he finished.The books also contain small activities in the back, ranging from drawing instructions to small quizzes and supplementary info on the book's themes. A good idea, but my little had no interest in them.","Good for getting your kiddo interested, not for challenging them",2023-05-06,3.0

It's one of my favorite franchises. I played through Pikmin 3 twice - once on my own on the WiiU, and once on the Switch co-op with my boyfriend. We had an amazing time.When I learned Pikmin 4 was coming out, I was sad to hear it wasn't going to have that same option for multiplayer. It has been replaced with something similar to Super Mario Galaxy 2 where it's just a controller for someone else to hold and occasionally toss things at enemies.That said, I knew this when I purchased it and discussed it with my boyfriend. He was aware and has been playing his own games and admiring the game while I play it just fine. This is something that was pretty clearly advertised on Nintendo's site and other resources, so the barrage of 1 star reviews for this game *just* for that are super uncalled for.Especially because this is my new favorite game in the series.First, the game itself is absolutely GORGEOUS. I never imagined these kinds of textures could be on the switch. The title screen itself shows you a gorgeous preview of the landscapes you end up exploring and can be left on in the background as just a gorgeous slideshow. The locations you go to are more explicitly part of the earth and you really get the feeling of scale of yourself and the Pikmin compared to the world at large. Every area I arrived at I just marveled at how pretty and detailed everything was and enjoyed looking around as I ran around with my pikmin collecting treasures and building bridges.The gameplay itself has so many subtle quality of life changes that any new player might not notice, but for veterans of the series:-Pikmin who are collecting multiple items in a stack will stay at base once they know the pile will be empty when they get there (no need to worry about grabbing them before sundown!)-If Pikmin are building a bridge or other structure, they'll wait at the structure once they're done so you can grab them and continue exploring-Instead of having to find what pile works for what bridge, you make the materials from your own stash of ""raw materials"" so you always know if you'll be able to build it.-You can move your spaceship and onion's location in an area to several other ""base"" points so your pikmin don't have to trek the entire map for one treasure.-You can *rewind time* if you mess up or if your pikmin get stuck somewhere it's hard to find (and the game will actually offer this to you if you end the day with pikmin left behind!) This happened to me once and I was able to go back in time 4 minutes and prevent their deaths.But perhaps the greatest QOL update is in your new doglike friend, Oatchi.Oatchi, aside from being cute, is almost another captain on his own. You can train him to be stronger and do more things, such as:-Going and collecting any ""idle"" pikmin (I used this ALL THE TIME. I mapped it to a shortcut. His pikmin retrieval makes it so I can focus more on finishing tasks and less on checking my map for where that lost pikmin went!) This also made it so I almost never left pikmin behind.-Sniffing out basically anything you're hunting for (Looking for that last treasure on the overworld in an area? Can't find a cave entrance? Ask him to sniff it out and you can follow his trail right to where they are, even if they're hidden!)-Carries you and your pikmin around (even through water!!!)-Can help carry things (increasingly heavy things if you train him!)-Can help attack enemies that your pikmin may be weak to (especially helpful in dungeons where you're restricted to certain kinds of pikmin!)-Can be told to guard an area when you're in a defense mission!-Can ram into walls to knock down things teetering off the top of them!-And many more!Oatchi's AI and all the things he can do is probably why we don't have two player story co-op in Pikmin 4 and honestly? I'll take that trade. He is AMAZING and makes the game so much more fun.The game also introduced a little hub area before you head to explore every day! This little hub is simple but great for collecting sidequests, helping castaways, and even increasing your pikmin numbers before the day and timer starts. It's also where you can train Oatchi and buy upgrades from the lab. It's a brief stop every morning but always leaves you with something to do or upgrade for the upcoming day!Overall, Pikmin 4 is an AMAZING addition to the pikmin franchise and I hope we continue to get more going forward. The details and QOL changes here are extremely promising and I can't wait to see what we  get next time.tl;dr: Pikmin 4 improves on previous games a TON and delivers a wonderful single-player experience for fans of previous pikmin games (Especially Pikmin 2!).",Very fun installment to a wonderful franchise,2023-07-24,5.0,R1ZKR92ASCVDUJ,napow,3.0,"The first thing I liked about this Pikmin is there is no limit. You don't have to constantly recover juice or have a limit of days. You can just play as you like. There are a lot of Pikmin and treasure to collect along with a lot of rescues. It's Pikmin as you expect it but I feel like it's actually less exploration and smaller than it used to be. On top of that, it's a lot shorter. It might be similar in content but it's a much quicker to beat game. I could easily 100% an area in a very short time and completed the game pretty quickly.Now the worst feature of the game is loading screens. They happen for almost every change. In a cave? Leaving a cave? Ending the day? Starting an area? Cut scene? So many loading screens. Sometimes it can take 30-60 seconds to load. Overall I'd say hours were wasted watching load screens like I'm playing a game from 2005. If it weren't for the load screens I probably would have beaten the game in a day or two. It's sad that Zelda has better graphics, better performance, and loads way faster than this. Pikmin isn't robust enough to be this slow. On top of that there hasn't been a patch to help with anything.This is the first Pikmin game with bugs, limitations, and gameplay issues that can make it a frustrating experience. The auto lock will focus on items over enemies. It will lock on enemies and make it difficult for you to call Pikmin back. There is no way to change it and even the gyro controls don't override it unless you hold the throw down. Not good for a battle.Dandori battle in story mode is the worst idea they had for this game. You are forced to play battle and it's really 2 on 1. The AI controls 2 players, you have to switch. This makes it a very uphill and unfair thing. On top of that it's forced split screen and you can't disable that. Even though you're playing against the CPU and not a 2P you see their split screen take up half the space. Then your screen is crowded with HUD info and it really leaves you with maybe 30% of your TV space to see what's in your view. It makes this mode almost unplayable and not fun at all. An enemy or treasure can take up your entire view so you can't see what's going on. I hated this mode so much.This might be the first Pikmin game with bugs. The Pikmin AI is really broken and random. Sometimes they do what they're supposed to and then randomly they'll just stand there. When you call them sometimes they just stand there and get eaten. The call button doesn't always work. Some actions can delay call actions for several seconds. I have to rewind constantly when these happen because I'll lose all of my Pikmin when call doesn't work. There are few settings adjustments to the game and all of the things I don't like can't be changed. They really ruin the feel and play of the game. Things that weren't problems in previous games.I really enjoyed this Pikmin or at least like 75% of it. The Dandori battles and bugs ruin it. Something that could be fixed with a patch, but still nothing. If I could disable split screen that would help. If you could change difficulty on some of the dandori that would also help. I can't imagine kids beating the end game dandori battles and not getting completely disappointed. This is not worth the price unless they fix the problems. I can't believe Nintendo released a game that is in this condition.","Some new features, bad decisions, worse execution",2023-08-31,3.0

For that reason, I've added one more star!",STUCK with ITS CONTROLLERS,2022-11-23,4.0,R1AL2FUWACCNTU,S. McGrath,1.0,"This is most definitely not for beginners at all. It is extremely complicated to figure out. After weeks of research, I am very confident that it does not have Android on it. It has an auto save function that seems to work on 8 & 16 bit games. Like NES & SNES. But it doesn't seem to work on Playstation games. The controller often needs to be mapped. And no matter what you do, it doesn't work properly for certain games or systems. For example Dreamcast Sonic is not playable. Because the directional pads do not work. You cannot make Sonic move. I literally downloaded every version of Sonic for Dreamcast I could find. Same result. So I bought different controllers. None of the controllers I bought would pair to the system. It would say it was connected, but it didn't work. So I wasted money on different controllers. It says it has 45+ emulators? Sure, but a lot of them are things like the Commodore 64. Which is essentially a very old computer system that requires a keyboard. This emulator doesn't have a keyboard. So I can't play those even if I wanted to. Wants me to type in a command. Not gonna do it. Can't. And a lot of the systems are handheld systems. Game boy, Game Boy color, Game Boy advance, Nintendo ds, Neo Geo pocket, Neo Geo Pocket color, Game Gear. Speaking of the game gear, it does have every Sega system from the Master System to genesis, 32x, Sega cd, Sega saturn, and of course the dreamcast. With Nintendo you're going to get regular nes, snes, Nintendo 64, and that's it. I'm kind of surprised there was no GameCube. The N64 did not have Donkey Kong 64. That kind of surprised me. I had to install it myself. Which brings me to the SD card. They pretty much maxed it out. So even though you can add stuff to the SD card, you're very limited. You're going to get the original PlayStation and nothing else. I'm surprised there was no original Xbox. For the most part, I find the PlayStation games tend to work pretty good. Before example, I was playing Crash Bandicoot and I beat several levels and when I went back to it the next time it had not saved anything. I almost want to return this. But then I think to myself screw it. At least I can play these games if I wanted to. It's better than nothing. It would be a lot cooler if you could actually save your place. For example, I have an old Arcade NES emulator. And I also have a SNES emulator. The SNES also does NES. Either one of these systems, if you press select and start at the same time, it brings up your save, load, or quit menu. And it will allow you to literally save whatever spot you are in those games. Which is absolutely wonderful for something like the original Mario game. Because not only can you start where you left off, you can load different lives and different locations. With multiple saves in each game. I was really hoping this system would do the same thing. One last thing. On the box, it does say that it has android. When it absolutely does not. On the box, It also says that the system itself has no system. This thing comes with two USB ports. One USB port is for your controllers. Both controllers will work with the One USB dongle. The other USB port is for a USB to SD card adapter. You plug in your SD card to the USB adapter dongle. And then you plug that into the system. Without that, there is no system. The entire operating system is on that micros. And the game box itself does not even have a MicroSD input natively. I found that very odd. After doing some research it appears that this system is actually a banana pie. Which is a cheaper raspberry pi. But even most cheap banana pies actually have a MicroSD slot input. So I'm not sure why they did this. Almost all emulator systems have a slot built in for an SD card.",Claims to have Android 9.1 but does not.,2023-06-12,2.0

""It's a miracle that any game is made.""Finally, a book that captures the complexity of game development that anyone can pick up and enjoy. Jason Schreier of Kotaku spent two years traveling around the world to score in depth interviews with the industry's most renowned gaming studios. Drawing from sources speaking both on and off the record, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels provides a rare glimpse into the pain and passion that go into bringing a modern video game to market. In ten absorbing chapters Schreier covers the downright grueling development process behind such hits as Blizzard's Diablo III, Naughty Dog's Uncharted 4, CD Projekt Red's The Witcher 3 and, of course, Bungie's Destiny.Speaking of Destiny, it was Schreier's crucial 2015 expos 00e9 that laid the groundwork for this wonderful little book. (Portions of his chapter on Destiny are taken directly from that article.) As fans of the blockbuster series will remember, that Kotaku piece brought Destiny's murky origin story to light. Importantly, it provided the necessary background for understanding how the company that gave us Halo could have produced  2014 at least at launch  2014 such a lackluster title. Subpar development tools, a strained relationship with publisher Activision, and the complete reboot of the story (following the departure of lead writer Joe Staten) a year out from release had much to do with it. As a source tells Schreier,  201cA lot of the problems that came up in Destiny 1...are results of having an unwavering schedule and unwieldy tools.""What we learned then from Scheier's keen reporting, and what comes across clear as day in his first book, is that making games is incredibly hard and almost impossibly demanding. Harder, perhaps, than any other creative medium. Thanks to their interactive nature and sheer potentiality, games are capable of delivering the boundless, memorable experiences we've come to love. But it's those same elements that make them such a chore to create, even for seasoned veterans.One of the designers at Obsidian (of Fallout: New Vegas fame) he interviews puts it this way: ""making games is sort of like shooting movies, if you had to build an entirely new camera every time you started."" Indeed, the tools and technologies used to develop the latest games are constantly in flux, as is the creative vision of the producers and directors at the top. A change in either area can prove hugely disruptive to the overall process  2014 a process that hinges on pushing a marketable product out the door by an agreed upon deadline. It's that constant give and take between concept and technology, between developer and publisher, that defines the medium.Internal conflicts can also run a project off course. Artists and programmers might spend months, years even, sketching and coding characters, environments, quests, set pieces and combat mechanics, only to see it all thrown out as a result of higher-ups taking the game in an entirely different direction. When Naughty Dog replaced Uncharted 4's creative director Amy Hennig in 2014  2014 roughly two years into the game's development  2014 the story was more or less scrapped. That meant that cut scenes, animation, and thousands of lines of recorded voicework on which the studio had already spent millions of dollars got the axe, too. For an artist emotionally invested in their work, this can be heartbreaking and demotivating.In other cases, such as the abortive Star Wars 1313, a decision by the publisher can bring it all crashing down. As Scheier recounts in the closing chapter, LucasArts, formerly a subsidiary of Lucasfilm, began work on a new action-adventure Star Wars game in 2010. The game debuted at E3 in 2012 to wide critical acclaim. Shortly afterward, the company was acquired by Disney. By 2013, Disney had shuttered the studio and canceled every one of its projects. For all the work the dedicated crew at LucasArts poured into their pet project, Star Wars 1313 was never meant to be.Given the many technical hitches, logistical nightmares, corporate pressures, and unforeseen obstacles that threaten success, it's no small wonder that any games are shipped at all. As Schreier points out, there's hardly a game on the market today that doesn't run up against insane crunch periods and dramatic setbacks over the course of its development. Whether it's a small team working on a 2D side-scroller  00e0 la Yacht Club Games' Shovel Knight or a massive effort spread across hundreds of staff in the case of BioWare's Dragon Age, producing a quality game in today's highly competitive environment is by any measure a herculean effort.Virtually every insider consulted for the book talks about how taxing the job can be on one's physical health and personal relationships. Burnout is common. And even with working around the clock for months on end  2014 often sans overtime pay, as it's not required in the US  2014 games rarely come out on time. Delays and cancellations are a feature, not a bug. To be sure, any successful career in game development is built on passion and an enthusiasm for creating unique playable spaces, but it's one that comes with significant costs that only the truly dedicated may be equipped to endure.Closing ThoughtsLeave it to Jason Schreier to shatter any utopic notions about game development. Behind the glossy visuals and destructible environments we take for granted on screen lies a hellish landscape of Sisyphean creative challenges and brutal working hours. As the title suggests, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels constantly reminds us that game production is as much about self-sacrifice as it is about crafting quality interactive experiences. And if these breezy oral histories are any indication, it's a principle that holds true whether you're a bootstrapped indie developer beholden to Kickstarter donors or a lowly cog in the big-budget corporate machine.Schreier is a most welcome guide, bringing more casual readers up to speed on esoteric conversations ranging from rendering paths and game engines to bug testing and content iteration times. It's a testament to his talents that the book never seems to flag, even when exploring games I didn't particularly care about. While I wish Schreier had ventured more deeply into the ethics of crunch culture, his penchant for meticulous, well researched investigative journalism is on full display here.If you have even a passing interest in gaming be sure to pick this one up. I came away with a better understanding of the personal sacrifices and creative compromises that appear to go hand in hand with making video games, and a newfound perspective on increasingly commonplace monetization strategies like paid downloadable content (PDLC) and microtransaction (MTX) systems. Above all, it left me with a more profound appreciation for my most cherished hobby.",Accessible to avid and casual gamers alike. Highly recommended.,2018-02-16,5.0,R16KQKB9YR5CXI,J. Foster,5.0,"Jason Schreier's treatise on the crazy world of game development pulls back the curtains on what often happens behind the scenes of some of our favorite games.  The torturous, complicated, and turbulent world of making a video game is put on display, as we get an insider's glimpse of the politics, the people, and the industry.  Most people are unaware of how difficult it is to actually bring a game to market successfully, let alone realizing that doing so usually requires many weeks, if not months, of 80- to 120-hour workweeks for entire teams of people.  After finishing the book, the tagline for ABC's iconic Wide World of Sports from the 70's seemed to fit perfectly for the developers, engineers, artists, designers and product leads that gave so much - ""the thrill of victory, and the agony of defeat.""Jason Schreier is news editor for the gaming website Kotaku, and has also provided articles related to video games to major media outlets, such as Wired, the New York Times, and the Onion.  As such, he is able to provide a knowledgeable take on the subject, deftly walking the line between explaining concepts and situations for the uninitiated that most gamers would already know, and still being fascinating and interesting to both.  His writing is solid, and easy to follow.Schreier's book consists of the in-depth story behind the making of 10 popular video games.  Often the stories read like fiction, with heroes and villains, twists and turns, sacrifices of unbelievable proportions, and evil empires, er, corporations.  Sometimes they end good, sometimes not.  And sometimes your not sure.  You'll have to decide if the price paid by all involved is worth the final product.  Because the price is often more than you realize when you boot up your favorite game for a few minutes of escapism.Even though I've given the book a 3 rating, please don't take this as meaning it is a bad book.  Quite the contrary.  On my scale this means it is still very much worth your time.  But at the end of the day, it reads like 10 very good separate, but thinly related, articles, as opposed to a strong and deep book.---------------I noticed Amazon and Goodreads have a slightly different meanings to their 5-point scale. I thought it was odd to have a different rating for the same book on two different sites, so I came up with my own scale below. For the record, it is fairly close to Amazon's scale, but allows me to be consistent between the two sites.5 - Fantastic. Life-altering. Maybe only 25 in a lifetime.4 - Very good.3 - Worth your time.2 - Not very good.1 - Atrocious",... often happens behind the scenes of some of our favorite games. The torturous,2018-06-01,3.0

No dedicated buttons: you have to set them each time you turn it on. And no dedicated Home button. (Some games, and all the Wii games, won't even let you escape the game, not even with the keyboard.)Speaking of keyboards, this is a BIOS system. That means it hooks up to your computer and it runs as an external hard drive that has to be booted up, or even worse, selected from the BIOS menu on your Windows computer.Why? Because you can't just plug this in to a running computer and have it run as software that you can install or click to start.You have to restart your computer.All the other similar systems on Amazon hook up to your TV.

We are talking about games for:- Atari- Capcom Play System (CPS)- Super Nintendo (FC)- Gameboy / 00a0Gameboy Advance / 00a0Gameboy Color- Sega Genesis (MD)- PlayStation (PS1)- Super Famicom (SFC)This was made possible through the inclusion of ""Game ROMs"" that the manufacturer placed onto the removable 64GB microSD memory card. The premise was simple: plug in the game stick into any TV's HDMI port and play! This even worked on a Toyota Sienna minivan's rear entertainment system! The key here is the connection interface: HDMI. Other emulators I had played with in the past connected via the Red/White/Yellow RCA (composite) cables -- whose ports some newer TVs no longer offer.Before we get into my review of the Anyando Wireless HDMI Game Console Stick, let us go over what Game ROMs are.WHAT ARE GAME ROMS?ROM stands for Read-Only Memory. Console games were shipped onto memory cards that could not be modified (""read-only""), but enthusiasts had found ways to copy them as ""ROM images"" as a way to preserve game history or for piracy. Whether that is illegal is a point of contention in the gaming and software industry, but at the time of writing this article, I was not able to find any definite answer since no US court had yet made a ruling.Emulators are software that mimic the game console with which the ROM image can be played. Since most do not contain any proprietary code, they almost certainly are lawful. Where the legal gray area exists are the ROMs themselves.DISCLAIMER: I am not an attorney. Any information shared here is general in nature and not to be taken as personal, professional, or legal advice.If you own the game, downloading a copy is not illegal. ""Fair Use"" gives you that right, though copyright holders often claim otherwise. Sharing ROMs, however, is against the law. Even the mere act of downloading a game via a peer-to-peer network (such as Torrent) could be considered ""sharing"" and thus illegal. However, if a game was no longer available for purchase, downloading a ROM image would not cause market harm, right? Especially if you previously owned a copy and the game cartridge had become damaged. That is where the gray area exists: no court had yet made any ruling on this matter. U.S. law does state:""Under section 117, you or someone you authorize may make a copy of an original computer program if the new copy is being made for archival (i.e., backup) purposes only; you are the legal owner of the copy; and any copy made for archival purposes is either destroyed, or transferred with the original copy, once the original copy is sold, given away, or otherwise transferred."" (U.S. Copyright Office)With that said, there are plenty of Internet sites that allow you to download ROM images for the games you legally already own. A search for ""Game ROMs"" resulted in dozens of sites, including ROMsGames (period) net, though most lawyers would likely agree that they are committing copyright infringement.ANYANDO HDMI GAME STICKLet us take a look at the Anyando hardware emulator. I previously mentioned how astounding it was to find over 10,000 games on a small HDMI stick with which you could play old titles on a television. All ROM images were stored in a specific folder structure on the included, 64gb microSD card. That meant you could add/remove ROMs as you wished, though such act probably is not legal if you did not also already own a copy of those games.NOTE: The Anyando game stick likely is committing copyright infringement. Purchase or use one at your own risk.Once you plugged the Anyando emulator into a HDMI interface, a USB source was required to supply power. This may be found at the back of the TV, a phone adapter, or a portable battery. I had found the emulator working on every test television and with a Toyota Sienna 2021 minivan's rear entertainment system. A blue light on the side of the stick indicated that it was powered on.Next, I had plugged the USB dongle into the stick so the two included, wireless game controllers could be paired via the 2.4 GHz radio frequency. This meant that direct line-of-sight was not required for controllers and console to communicate with one another. A red light (left) on the controller was Player 1, and Green light (right) was Player 2.Navigating the console emulator was one of the more straight-forward ones. There were 5 tabs:- List of games- Games by console ""class""- History of games that had been launched- Collection of games that were bookmarked via the Controllers' bottom L2/R2 buttons- SearchPush the controller's top L1/R1 buttons to jump between tabs. You could save/load game states (made possible with the removable microSD card) and restart/exit titles via the controllers themselves -- a nice feature since most emulators I had tried required one to physically reboot from the console itself.Most of the games played well, though some of the newer ones had some audio distortion due to, presumably, an underpowered CPU chip. Perhaps the company will produce higher-powered game sticks in the future for the games to run more smoothly. Some games did run into a variety of errors, including not being able to play with a second player.There are some limitations to be aware of with ROM emulators in general:- All games will look pixelated, especially on today's 4K televisions-- The Anyando, however, looked pretty good since it connected directly via the HDMI interface- Game selection could be maddening even with the Search feature-- Game list was just HUGE to navigate through!-- Large number of duplicate games: different region versions (ie. US, JP, EU) and/or different systems (ie. Gameboy, Gameboy Advance, PlayStation)-- Bookmark (""Collection"") feature helped a bitFrom an emulator perspective, one could only wish for the navigation interface to be improved upon in future iterations, including:- Listing the game console type next to each game- Ability to hide or delete games right from the interface itself (with a parental pin, of course, to prevent kids from accidentally wiping them out)FINAL THOUGHTSLegality of the Anyando game emulator aside, from an educational perspective, it was an impressive piece of hardware to test. It was one of the more advanced ones I had tried, and the ability to connect it directly to an available HDMI television port brought so many conveniences and benefits for portable gaming. It enabled fans to play titles again that no longer are available for purchase, or to bring back to life games one had purchased decades ago.","Stand-out feature: HDMI interface! Fun, nostalgic games with some quirks",2022-03-08,5.0,RYI7WPTN5RG2J,Ebonnie,3.0,"I was so stoked when this gaming system arrived that I had my son set it up straight away. He was able to set it up quickly and with ease. The only issue (with may not really be an issue) he ran into was the cord being to short to reach the outlet he wanted to use. He eventually just unplugged one his other gaming consoles and connected this one.Once we connected the controllers (you'll need 4 AAA batteries) went to battle. The first 2 player game we tried was Battle Tetrus (not the name of it). This game was fun with a clear idea of how to play and move the pieces around.  Next, we tried a little Mario. Again, easy to figure out and play. Once we got to the old skool Street Fighter & Mortal Combat games, I was EXTREMELY disappointed.  The graphics were so bad. You couldn't even make out the figures on the screen. It was Iike two blobs jumping around. I wanted to use this as a fun way to connect with my 18yr old on a rainy day just chilling around the house, but this was disappointing to say the least.Great concept just poor execution on the REALLY OLD GAMES.",Disappointed,2023-04-22,3.0

After much debating and reading the review by  Eirick Skywalker  I settled on this. Let me say this was a very good decision. My mother whose near 80 loves this. Her and my father used to play Burger Time endlessly in their free time. Now she is back to playing and enjoying the game though without my father. I 2019d highly recommend this system to anyone looking for the 80 2019s. I played it a whopping 15 minutes and never experienced any issue even using 2 extensions on a single controller to get the reach needed for mom to play. She 2019s been playing and enjoying the game with no issues either. Just be attentive and order the extension cables as the cables with the unit are rather short.  I 2019d recommend 2 sets one set for each controller. Now the game console itself is small and in a good way, it takes up no room literally it 2019s about 6 inches wide and long and 3 inch tall. Perfect for a non cluttered look, except the extension cables which who cares about that minor issue, its the 80 2019s. The controller itself is a bit small, but very responsive. It 2019d be an easy 10 star item if the controller was just a bit bigger. Hats off to the designer for bringing the 80 2019s back in a very positive way. As it 2019s been used now for about 40 hours, I have not had the have to mash all buttons syndrome to get to any of the menus. Nor have I have seen any game listed more than once as others claimed. They are single copies and placed in order of action, puzzle, and such, arranged nice and neat. I ponder on a few reviews if they bought the item from another seller mixing that up with this unit?

For that reason, I've added one more star!",STUCK with ITS CONTROLLERS,2022-11-23,4.0,R1AL2FUWACCNTU,S. McGrath,1.0,"This is most definitely not for beginners at all. It is extremely complicated to figure out. After weeks of research, I am very confident that it does not have Android on it. It has an auto save function that seems to work on 8 & 16 bit games. Like NES & SNES. But it doesn't seem to work on Playstation games. The controller often needs to be mapped. And no matter what you do, it doesn't work properly for certain games or systems. For example Dreamcast Sonic is not playable. Because the directional pads do not work. You cannot make Sonic move. I literally downloaded every version of Sonic for Dreamcast I could find. Same result. So I bought different controllers. None of the controllers I bought would pair to the system. It would say it was connected, but it didn't work. So I wasted money on different controllers. It says it has 45+ emulators? Sure, but a lot of them are things like the Commodore 64. Which is essentially a very old computer system that requires a keyboard. This emulator doesn't have a keyboard. So I can't play those even if I wanted to. Wants me to type in a command. Not gonna do it. Can't. And a lot of the systems are handheld systems. Game boy, Game Boy color, Game Boy advance, Nintendo ds, Neo Geo pocket, Neo Geo Pocket color, Game Gear. Speaking of the game gear, it does have every Sega system from the Master System to genesis, 32x, Sega cd, Sega saturn, and of course the dreamcast. With Nintendo you're going to get regular nes, snes, Nintendo 64, and that's it. I'm kind of surprised there was no GameCube. The N64 did not have Donkey Kong 64. That kind of surprised me. I had to install it myself. Which brings me to the SD card. They pretty much maxed it out. So even though you can add stuff to the SD card, you're very limited. You're going to get the original PlayStation and nothing else. I'm surprised there was no original Xbox. For the most part, I find the PlayStation games tend to work pretty good. Before example, I was playing Crash Bandicoot and I beat several levels and when I went back to it the next time it had not saved anything. I almost want to return this. But then I think to myself screw it. At least I can play these games if I wanted to. It's better than nothing. It would be a lot cooler if you could actually save your place. For example, I have an old Arcade NES emulator. And I also have a SNES emulator. The SNES also does NES. Either one of these systems, if you press select and start at the same time, it brings up your save, load, or quit menu. And it will allow you to literally save whatever spot you are in those games. Which is absolutely wonderful for something like the original Mario game. Because not only can you start where you left off, you can load different lives and different locations. With multiple saves in each game. I was really hoping this system would do the same thing. One last thing. On the box, it does say that it has android. When it absolutely does not. On the box, It also says that the system itself has no system. This thing comes with two USB ports. One USB port is for your controllers. Both controllers will work with the One USB dongle. The other USB port is for a USB to SD card adapter. You plug in your SD card to the USB adapter dongle. And then you plug that into the system. Without that, there is no system. The entire operating system is on that micros. And the game box itself does not even have a MicroSD input natively. I found that very odd. After doing some research it appears that this system is actually a banana pie. Which is a cheaper raspberry pi. But even most cheap banana pies actually have a MicroSD slot input. So I'm not sure why they did this. Almost all emulator systems have a slot built in for an SD card.",Claims to have Android 9.1 but does not.,2023-06-12,2.0

Works amazingly. Some games work better on Android, some work better on JELOS, and honestly, I even often use the stock FW for tough games that require a lot of load/save states because I find the hotkeys easier. The device itself is well made and super cute. Good battery, great screen, classic membrane mush feel. Couldn't be happier for the very reasonable price.As others have said, back up your firmware and flash a better SD Card. Plus, you'll need to supply your own games unless you buy this thing from another source. I chose Amazon because of easy returns just in case and the games that came with my 353p are wanting. So I had to supply my own. NES, SNES, and PS1 really shine, while GB, GBC, GBA seem as good. N64 is notoriously difficult to emulate but it honestly plays almost perfectly here, especially on Android. Perfectionists will always squirm but I'm 43 and remember the old hardware not always running perfectly either so whatever. 3DO was a nice surprise. Works flawlessly. Haven't tried much DS, GG, Saturn, or Dreamcast but plenty of videos detail it.Can't believe this thing isn't higher rated. For those of you who are afraid of the learning curve, I installed JELOS myself by following online tutorials and had zero problems. I'm not that much of a computer guy, either. It's really not as hard as you're thinking. If anything, the biggest challenge is sourcing roms and even that's pretty easy, especially with all the tutorials out there.

At only 5-feet long, most people will need to provide their own.Having been born in the 60's, these are the type of games I played in my teenage years. I remember having such a great time. Now I can visit my younger years some. My wife was born in the late 60's and she's played many of these games too.  My son and I were playing and I was surprised how many of these games he has played on another console we have. Having this has been great for us. It helps me have time with him, at an age when he would rather be alone or with his friends.The graphics aren't too bad, I've seen worse on some other game consoles I own.I really am having a good time and happy I ordered this.",Fun From the 80's,2023-09-07,4.0,R2MX2Z33KPPJYB,Shopaholic,1.0,"Picked up this console game filled with emulated games for a retro throw back.It arrived without any issues, and I was surprised at how small the overall unit and controllers were.I plugged everything in and got it set up. The games included were a great retro throw back to when I was a child.It proved to be very fun. I do wish the overall in controller pairing process was a bit smoother as it seemed to glitch out a few times before it stuck.It also has a bit buggy of a control on some games.With that said, it's a fun toy to have.",torn...,2023-09-17,3.0

With an action RPG, with a bit of platforming, that's what I'd title this.Combat for the most part, is solid. BUT the big thing is, a lot of your attacks, go into ""auto attack"".. like once you start it up, your character will finish it for you. Now, this is great in theory, in reality as the enemy with its super armor completely ignores your attacks and molest your face with the blunt strong end of a weapon, its a HORRIBLE implementation.The game just randomly quits at what I would consider completely random times. I'm sure this will be patched out? It has happened infrequently enough that its not a killer, and it has not happened during ANY boss fights as of yet, so its not a deal breaker.Things I love about the game:Armors-SO MANY COOL ONES! With full-set bonuses actually worth a hoot.The Loot system, and how you get your armor. This is top notch and it works really well! Your clearly told how to get pieces of armor, and then you do what your advised in game, and it works! (Its not like the Poise in DarkSouls3 where.. we all know what Poise is.. and how it works, and suddenly someone is changing the function on us, and then telling us it works right.. *Coughs* Miyazaki san.... ) The experience/currency, you can actually bank it back at your home base, which is every spec op room. This is a godsend. The only thing is, you have to make it back without dying to bank it. Easy in theory, but put to action its not always easy. It depends on if you left enemies alive. Your rewarded for being methodical in taking out enemies.The Vertical and Horizontal attacks, vs (Strong and weak attacks) I really love this method! it works well. And in place of strong attacks you have *Charged attacks* and this works very good.I liked the level design for the most part. A lot of short cuts and ways to tackle areas.. its just a matter of finding the short cuts, etc.Character creation is non existent other than the outfit you wear and the accessories you decide to use.You have no stats to upgrade other than your ""Core"".. now basically this is like your generator. So the more you upgraded it the more accessories you can power.-That being implants & Armor. Because your exo rig, is always with you, and what you put on it.. is implants and armor pieces.Speaking of implants, this is another area where the developers of this game, 'Deck13' if I'm not mistaken really did something nice for the players. They give you a lot of options with the implants. You can stack them, or not.. which is nice, but at the same time, you have to level up your core ALOT so you can power these implants.. and get the character you want.The weapons, are both basic and cool at the same time. My favorite at least in appearance is the Plasma axe, heavy weapon you get later in the game from defeating a certain boss. It's slow to attack, but with the right suit of armor it comes out pretty good. (read the lynx rig/armor)Things I'd love to see ""fixed' or added:Speaking of leveling up your core, when you first start out in this game, getting health upgrades and health injections.. it feels like the enemies are horribly op.. even later in the game, I'm at level 70 on my core.. the enemies still feel OP.. most of there attacks just seem to knock the ever loving crap outta you, health upgrades be danged. I don't know exactly whats going on if they have a counter system or something, or the attacks are based on a percentage of health.. But the damage seems ridiculous. After upgrading my armor and weapons and leveling up my core, I'd like to feel a bit more rewarded I suppose?I wish the armor, didn't use up so much energy to be equipped. Just a wish. Its bad enough trying to have the right *upgrade material* level 1,2 or 3 or 4.. and then building it.. and THEN needing the appropriate energy to equip it.. that's overkill.I wish there was a good map system for this game. It sorely needs one. They have little signs you can find around the levels.. but if your trying to get some place specific and you've hopped back from another area.. it really really gets hard to manage.. By manage I mean remember.Because the game has a lot of secrets.. from armor to weapons and little areas where you have to back track.Just a good 2d map system, showing what level your on.. by that I mean the levels are not only expansive horizontally but vertically as well.I'd like NOT to get kicked out of the menu when I click play on the audio files.Flashlights.. The flashlights in this game suck, like horror movie bad in my opinion.Boss fights are ridiculous. Way too many layers to peel away as it stands. Like they do TOO MUCH damage. Which is what makes the fights ridiculous.. You go through that gauntlet of enemies to reach them, and hope you have enough injectables, and then they one shot you.It seems like the idea of a good action RPG is not enough, all these game developers are like ""Oh we gotta compete with Dark Souls in brutality "".. well it'd be easy to beat the darksouls series/Fromsoftware if you just made a good action RPG that was also fun.. just a little fun, and a lot of awesome.Anyways, overall I'm happy with my purchase, but I've had some VERY frustrating moments with losing my currency in game because I ran out of time trying to get to it, which left a very bitter taste in my mouth.If I think of anything else I'll add it to my review. Over all like I said, I'm happy with the game. Its a lot better than 'Lords of the Fallen' by leaps and bounds in the combat system/gameplay. I tried to play ""Lords of the Fallen' and could never get into the game.*December 31,2017 Update:*So some things I did not realize, about dying and retrieving tech scrap. If you kill enemies, it adds on to your 'time limit' to get back to your dropped 'tech scrap""I recently played and beat the DLC. It was short and bitter sweet. I wish it had been more expansive.It did add 3 new Rigs:""Ogre"" ""Eagle"" & ""Mantis""Ogre full set, all your attacks that slam into the ground release a seismic shockwave, because of the weapons I use, haven't gotten much outta this. And since the Armor doesn't seem to stop much damage (Maybe theirs a certain set up I need to make it work good?) I like to be able to move on my feet and dodge enemy attacks so they don't show me who's boss.Eagle full set, gives you a bonus to your injectables. Like you get more bang for buck. I had 15 installed and it bumped it up to 20. Which is nice.The Mantis Full Set, gives you a bonus- It reduces all inject-able energy cost by 25%. (I've not played with any builds that rely on injectables, so no benefit to me)The level is based around a ""theme park"". . . It is accessible at two different points in the game. (So if your sitting there wandering how you get the items, like my bad self in that broken stair well), well now you know! So the first access point is the Train. The second access point, is from the ""Research & Development"" area, that you access, by defeating a boss, which you reach just by making it to a certain point in the story.One of the new ""weapons"" you gain access to in the DLC is something called ""Mangled Articulators"" they are a ""twin rigged"" set up. Long story short, with the Ogre armor they are pretty fun to use. I really had not used any of this weapon type until this item.Deck 13 as a side note release a ""free"" ""fire & ice"" DLC that gives a few perks.Anyways, be nice if Deck 13 released some more DLC.Also some things I noticed about the game. Less Freezing than initial release. Like I've still had the game just randomly quit on me. But its been more rare than when The Surge first came out. Its annoying, but I'D STILL BUY the game today, knowing what I know. The ""finishing"" moves, have lead to less deaths than I recall happening to me when the game first came out as well. I don't know if Deck 13 changed anything per say. (because if you head to their website, and under ""The Surge"" game their is no list of updates or whatever that makes this obvious. )I still wish there were maps. Levels are SO big.. Not many of them, but they loop around on themselves and everything it just gets really hectic sometimes. You can't tell where you need to go and where you've been. Although the DLC, their is no issues navigating it.I also wish the staffs, and axes and hammers type weapons, controlled in more predictable patters off the base attacks. Because the enemies attack so fast, that unless your PLANNING to attack one.. things can just go to pot so quick and you can't take out the enemies quick enough.TL:DR Buy the game, learn the combat, enjoy.

So, if you don 2019t have a Nintendo Online subscription, you are locked out of the progression system.  There are no bosses or metals to earn in the game.If you get a physical copy, it includes the leg strap. It 2019s the exact same as the one you get from  2018Ring Fit Adventure 2019. As stated in my review for that one; wished it had double banded vecro instead of one as it can slip down. If you plan to buy digital, you can buy the strap separately for $10 (MSRP). Note that the digital version is $10 cheaper (without leg strap)7 Sports total. Wii Sports Resort had 13, but also with more modes within individual sports4 returning sports from Wii Sports/Wii Sports Resort: Tennis, Bowling, and Swordplay (now called chambira), Golf (as part of free update in Fall 2022)3 new sports: football (soccer), volleyball, and badmintonSeeing that there 2019s free DlC. It may have live service updates (Like Animal Crossing NH, and Splatoon). No official announcement yet aside from Golf. Hoping for Basketball freethrow, and return of archery in the future at no additional cost if they plan to add more sportsWill give my impressions on each sport at the end (excluding Golf seeing this is a near launch review).Seeing it 2019s a near launch review; cannot comment on any gameplay changes, future dlc (more additional sports, or added modes within sports)Plays like Wii Sports/Wii Sports Resort as you make exaggerated movements or flick of the wrist to have your avatar do moves onscreen. For most games, you don 2019t really control the positioning of your character. You can do movements around the field with joy stick, but seeing how small the field is, charactgers automatically moves you most of the time.  You won 2019t get a workout unless you play for hours at a time. If you want to sweat, I 2019d get  2018Ring Fit Adventure 2019 insteadNo training mode, or practice mini-games like past Wii Sports titles. For some sports you just get a basic tutorial then just play. Doesn 2019t explain hidden rules and tips wellNo boss battles like past titles either. You do get 3 difficulty modes: Normal, Strong, and Powerhouse. If you play offline there 2019s no high score tracking or any progression. They are just pick-up gamesNow has online. Nintendo Online membership required. Note that you need to play online to get points to spend on cosmetics. If there 2019s not enough players, there are CPU fill ins. Don 2019t get why you can 2019t play with CPU offline and still get points.-Controls:Use gyroscope in Joy-cons instead of Gyro + sensor bar in Wii/Wii U games.Seeing I have adult sized hands; holding the small jon cons doesn 2019t feel as nice as the Wii Remote. Z button on joy cons are not as ergonomic to press than wii mote (especially when playing bowling).There is a left handed mode optionMotion controls only (unlike Ring Fit Adventure which had button only mode). If you own a Switch Lite, must play on table top on small screen, and buy individual joycons. Note: you only can play table top mode (Any version of Switch console) in single player. If you try to play with more than one person, the game won 2019t let you play. Guess they added this feature to prevent eye squinting and people bumping into each other due to the small screen.-New AvatarsMiis make a return (via faces), but you can also use the Sportsmates avatars (anime-esk artstyle) if you want. Now have arms and legs instead of floating arms and feetWhen you play as Miis, you cannot import mii from other friends 2019 account, or other accounts that 2019s not on your Switch systemIn terms of customization: Sportsmates are more focused on individual clothes than faces on Miis.If you do plan to play as Miis; only can equip new body clothes. Cannot equip face accessories like hats, masks, beards and glassesThere are unlockable outfits. Again, tied to online modes. There are default customization options for Sportmates if you don 2019t have Nintendo Online, but the selection is limited. Cosmetic unlocks change out weekly (cheap mobile game FOMO tactic), so it encourages you to play regularly.Other unlockable include name tags/titles where you select a two words (an adjective/greeting, and noun) that show above your name in versus screen. Also emotesEveryone gets different board sets. 24 items total to unlock before they go away.  Unlocks are tied to RNG/random on what unlocks first/what order.Overall, If you own Wii Sports Resort it 2019s basically the same core experience, but that game had more sports and modes to play around with.Feels like an unfinished game at launch. At launch, aside from the updated HD graphics, and ability to play online; don 2019t see a reason to pick up this new game unless you don 2019t have Wii Sports Resort, a Wii or Wii U, or too lazy to take it out of storage.This game like Wii Sport, and Wii Sports Resort is very fun with others. Still get that excitement when playing with people locally who you haven 2019t seen in a while; like playing an ice breaker type board gameNow onto my take on each individual sport.--List of games (at launch):1. TennisSame as Wii Sports games, but stricter on the on timing.Character position automatically, only need to focus on swingsRotate wrist for top spin or backspinCan 2019t play singles tennis. Only doubles. When playing 1v1 you control two people and it feels like a tennis foosball fusion gameAble to set match length/sets. Not sure why there 2019s no option for it in badminton and volleyballWished it was more options like Mario Tennis Aces.2. BowlingSame bowling in Wii Sports and Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide ClassicsControls a bit different. Need to hold the Z button throughout and not let go when you want to release, so it 2019s one smooth motion. For me doesn 2019t feel as naturalCan 2019t swing the ball backwards and scare the spectators anymore. Actually there are no spectators unless you count those standing very far away on the above floorsAble to do 4 player local split screen. No need to take turns. Can play 8 players online  (up to 2 people local can joining in)Special lanes return with ramps, obstacles and hill slope lanes. Sort of like Spin Control in Wii Sports ResortNo (up to) 100 pin challenge or Spare Pickup modeOnline only mode Survival is a 16 player Bowling Battle Royal. Highest score progress to next stage while others are eliminated. Aside from the high score tennis wall ball mini-game in the credits, this is the best mode in the game at launch in my opinion3. ChambaraPlays like Sword Play in Wii Sports ResortCan select type of sword this time: Standard, Charged or Twin SwordPress ZL to block or guard.Standard Sword has best base attack.For Charge Sword , you build up charge attack meter every time block perfectly (position block perpendicular of opponent 2019s attack). When meter is full, you can do one strong attack. Note that base attack is weaker than Standard SwordTwin Sword is basically duel welding. Need two joycons per player obviously. Able to block with one sword and get ready for attack with other. Cannot attack and defend simultaneously. Able to spin attack when sword is charged. Unlock Charge Sword it 2019s based on how many times swing an attack than blockNo showdown mode like in Wii Sports Resport4. Soccer:Two modes:Traditional Soccer match with a life size ball: 4v4 or 1v1. Use two joycons per person. One you swing with your arms to kick and shoot. Heard they 2019re adding in leg strap/kick support in later patch. With other joycon you move/run around joystick. ZL to dash, ZR to pass, B to jump. Swing two hands down for head dive.The field is too big in comparison to character 2019s movement speed in my opinion. Stamina bar doesn 2019t help.  Not as fast as Rocket League, but has better control than Lucio Ball (Overwatch)Soccer Shootout-Mode. Basically, a penalty shootout. Use leg strap, able to kick with leg this time instead of swinging your arms. Careful not to kick the TV. Ball will be thrown at you and you must kick it at the right time to get a goal5. Volleyball:Game positions your avatar for you like in Tennis. Most of the time the game auto positions you, but can make slight move adjustments with joystick when blocking. This mini-game is all about timing and knowing which motion to do at the right time. Game will tell you if you 2019re doing it too early, or perfectlyMain motions to focus on are Bump, Spike and BlockShake down or swat down movement to spikeTwo hands in the air to set and blockServe by swinging arms up or downUnderhand lift up to Dig or BumpGame will give you tips/prompts suggestions on what to do4 player split screen if you play local co-op. Shows each player on 4 separate screens. Don 2019t get why they don 2019t do double split screen for each team6. BadmintonLike tennis but more involved and faster. Need faster reaction time seeing the smaller fieldNeed to press ZL for a drop shotOnly can play singles. No doublesThere 2019s a hidden stamina system. If you swing frantically your character will get tired and accuracy will lower","Online Required Unlocks, Live Service. Worse than Switch Sports Resort at Launch.",2022-04-29,3.0

U get games from famicom, super nintendo, Nintendo and sega genesis. It might not be 6000 games but its most definitely 5000 games. I had it for a month and every time i play theres a different game to play. Great system",The jxd masterpiece,2021-11-20,5.0,R38PZJBN944L6O,Will Hughes,40.0,"Since technology is becoming more and more advanced, there's plenty of new and up-coming devices every year that makes life easier and fun. Emulator devices are also becoming more and more popular as well as more advanced. These days, emulator devices can play multiple types of systems ranging from 8-bit to 32-bit (and higher) games.This new JXD is no exception. With the ability to do many of the classical gaming consoles from the late 1980's to mid 1990's, there's plenty of games to play. I have been a fan of JXD over the years and this one is no exception. (I actually first purchased one of the early models that was designed on the android OS)This device can do many of the classical consoles as follows...NESSNESSega GenesisGameboyGameboy ColorGameboy Advanced... and some others. It also does a few arcade classics, which already come with some good arcade titles. Most of the titles work great and play well. The controls take some getting used to, but you can change them around a bit for your own personal use.The device comes in a neat box and contains the following...1 gaming JXD device1 USB cord (for charging the device and adding games from your PC)1 plug for use with the USB for charging only1 soft slip case to keep your JXD from dust1 set of wired ear-piece to listen to sound privately1 video cord so you can play your games on a bigger screen1 instruction bookletThe device itself looks like a modified PSP with 2 analog sticks, control pad on the left and 4 buttons on the right, a START and SELECT buttons and 2 shoulder buttons for your L and R buttons.It can also view image files, play mp3 files, read TXT files, and play videos of various formats. (I haven't had a problem with scaling as it seems to auto-correct the size of the videos and pictures to fit the screen) You can view videos and pictures in either file view or thumbnail view. It comes with a 16-gig SD card (TF card) so you have more than enough space to add games, videos, music, TXT files, and pictures that you like. If you also want to take photos or record a video, it has camera on the back of the device to do just that. Mind you the quality is pretty low, so don't expect to take great quality photos like a professional.THE CONS========Sadly, the devices does have some problems, they are as follows...1.) Some ROMs don't play perfectly2.) Some ROMs had sound/music issues (drums or bass notes missing, Weapon Lord had sound issues)3.) Some ROMs did have some graphical issues (""Pinbot"" and ""Ikari Warriors III"" for NES)4.) Although most 8-bit games played well, the 16-bit games had speed issues (Streets Of Rage 2)5.) Although most console ROMs were easy to copy over, adding playable arcade games is a challenge6.) The USB cord was only about 1 ft. long, although not a major issue if you can find a longer cord7.) The instruction booklet mentions various JXD models, but hard to tell which one is as it's black&white8.) This model is NOT a touch screen, must use controller to move around the menus9.) When viewing images in ""thumbnail"" mode, it writes an additional small file for cachingFor the most part, most of the games I added worked pretty well. The device can play multiple formats of the console games (SMD/BIN for Genesis, SFC/SMC for SNES, etc.) It can also play some hacked ROMs, but not all of them. A few games I tried either gave an ""Invalid Error"" or reset the JXD device. The only arcade games I could play were the ones that came with the device and they were icons which you could select. Also, if you select the ""3D Arcade Games"" icon, it gave you a list of some other arcade games you could play. There's actually quite a bit so you will enjoy the list it has. If you can play more arcade games, I haven't figured out how or what was used to get added games to work. Supposedly you could play the ""Capcom"" and ""NeoGeo"" arcade style games. If it's true, it requires a bit of work to get them to play, as simply adding them to a folder and then selecting them, isn't enough. The instruction manual only talked about what the device does and what each part of the device does. It also talked about the various models they had. Sadly it was hard to figure out which model I had since all the images were black and white and all the models seemed to be based on the ""white"" colored model, so they all looked the same, despite the fact that they all claimed to be different from each other. Lastly, the screen is pretty much a color LCD, and a cheap one at that. Staring at it once in a while gave me a headache because of the color tone.Overall it's not a totally bad device, but you will have to figure out which games work well and which won't. Most games work okay, but a few games ran on what seemed like 20 fps or less. (Streets Of Rage 2 varied from time to time, sometimes ran at 30 fps, other times at 20 or less) Most of the NES titles ran in it's full speed, as well as the Gameboy and Gameboy Advance games. Just be careful as some NES games aren't emulated perfectly. (""TMNT III"" for NES had music issues, ""Pinbot"" and ""Ikari Warriors III"" for NES had graphical issues, ""Dragon Warrior IV"" for NES couldn't play, except the one that came with the JXD worked fine, but it's the Jap version) Still, not a bad device to have.Hope my review helped you figure out if this is worth it. ^_^","Not a bad device, but not great...",2020-05-23,3.0

Replaces the original's grid-based mechanics with a circular distance mechanism. The game is still based on a grid, but allows characters a bit more freedom of movement and shows distances in a circle surrounding the character to give a greater sense of realism.Cons: Even less attached to the Mario series than the first game: Mario & Company could just as easily be replaced by more Rabbids with little loss to story. A rearrangement of the techniques used by characters in the first game makes some much more useful than others (particularly Rabbid Peach and Luigi.) No undo system this time, and once a jump or landing is performed (even if by accident) you are committed and a mistake can leave your character wide open to attack. The game also has a huge amount of bugs: both graphical, with lots of pop-in and plane shearing, and functional, with characters getting infinitely stuck alternating between two grid squares, the game randomly crashing after a targeted enemy is defeated (especially in the final battle), and one of the quests does not register as completed no matter how many times you do it. For a game that took many extra months of development and is now 3+ weeks from release without resolution, such bugs do not reflect well on Ubisoft or the latest version of the Snowdrop engine. Were it not for such obvious defects it would be worthy of a perfect score.Some have also complained that the Rabbids are now voiced (short two or three word fragments mostly) and have dialogue, but I didn't mind.

I'll break this review into a few parts.Firstly, can't complain about something that looks decent and costs under $50. If I had more freedom of choice I might have gotten one of the sale prints but the event determined the need for subdued. Received it in two days, giving me enough time to wash it before wearing.Secondly, the fabric is a slinky kind of knit, not too thin but not too heavy. It was tolerable outdoors in triple-digit-heat-index weather. It had great movement too; I didn't feel at all restricted climbing into and out of a tall vehicle, and while walking/standing all day. For me it required a sweater indoors, but the funeral parlor was admittedly kept cold. After washing and drying, I hung it up and didn't need to iron; it also showed no wrinkles at the end of wearing all day.Thirdly, the fit. I'm short with an Unfortunately Sized bust; I have to fit everything to that part of the anatomy and hope I can make enough alterations elsewhere to not look horrible. This is a true wrap dress and that aspect helped me in getting a decent fit at waist and hips. The armholes for me gapped a little; the shoulders are a little too tall (admittedly my shoulder-to-bust distance is shorter than most manufacturers cut and I always have this problem). I wore a black bra underneath to minimize any undergarment peek but I'll need to make a formal alteration at some point. Sleeves would have solved this problem but I didn't want to go with longer sleeves in the warm weather. I also needed to add two safety pins: one next to the button for security  2014 my button held fine but I didn't want to tempt fate based on some experiences in other reviews here  2014 and one where the neckline overlapped as leaning forward caused the front to gap indecently open. A person with a smaller bust might not have as much of a gap problem but the more generously endowed may consider the mighty safety pin. A small snap added to the overlap would also solve the gap problem.Overall I have no complaints as this did everything I needed it to do, and comfortably enough to consider ordering the dress in another color.","B on fit, A+ on fabric",2023-08-18,4.0,R33NO5LD7WG99K,Debbie,0.0,"The dress is heavier than I thought it would be.

If I purchase another, I'll order a 5X because I prefer loose fitting clothes.",Light and Comfy,2023-08-18,4.0,R3D4RMN2OMS1UX,J L,52.0,"I ordered the orange dress in both XL and 2XL because I was not sure the XL would fit.  I am 5' 7 and somewhere between 175 - 185 lbs (I have not weighed in a while).  The 2XL was much too large and too long, and it looked like it was a return they packed up and sent out again.  I think 2XL would be better suited to someone who is perhaps 225 lbs.The XL is really a bit too long, although a knot at the end of the dress would help if one was wearing flats; otherwise, one would need to wear at least a 2"" heel to make this length work without touching the ground as one moves around, bending, getting in and out of vehicles, etc.  It almost touches the ground whilst I am standing straight up.I think a Large would be a better for someone my height and weight in terms of both length and width, BUT I fear a Large would be too tight beneath the armpits.  The XL just barely feels good beneath the armpits.  The neckline on the XL is good.  There is plenty of room across the bust, the waist, and the hips in the XL.  I am very tempted to order a Large to see if it would not be too tight beneath the armpits, but then there is the CRUCIAL issue of sheerness to consider.I think the pattern/colour is absolutely beautiful, but as other reviewers before me have said, the material is very, very thin, exceedingly thin.  You can hold the dress up in front of you and look through two layers of it and still see everything on the other side quite clearly.Having said all this, if the dress was only $15-$20, I might not have qualms about keeping it, but with tax this dress cost nearly $40!!!  I expect a heck of a lot better material for $40.  At least one other reviewer described the material as being like a bandana.  I could not agree more, and not a high quality bandana at t that.  I am so sad.  I love the colour and pattern, and I would order 2-3 more colours if the material was a lot nicer.  As is, this material could be twice as thick and still be very thin.So, the XL is going to have to go back as well.  I just cannot fathom spending this much money for something this sheer and flimsy feeling--without sufficient undergarments, this dress is obscenely thin!  Not only that, but I would have to buy either a slip and/or pantaloons or tights to wear under this dress, which would push the cost up by another $20+.  That would be a minimum of $60+ dollars to make this dress wearable anywhere but at home alone.  Think about that for a moment.  With appropriate undergarments, the cost to wear this dress would be at least $60.  That is outrageous and NOT a good value AT ALL.If they used a much better fabric than this, I would happily pay $40 (with the tax) for one of these, but not for something this sheer.  I would be shocked even to pay $20 for it.  $15 would be more in line with the quality and with what you would have to do to make the dress wearable.  I am going to go to Walmart or Target or some such store to look for something.  Some items from China are very nice quality, for example, Apple products, but most of the stuff from China is overpriced grot, and these dresses are a prime example of that sad fact.  I can go to higher end department stores and find much higher quality clothing on sale for this price.  The only reason I do not do that is because I no longer enjoy shopping in stores.  If I did still enjoy it, I would go to the mall regularly and watch for good sales on much better quality clothing.I do NOT recommend these dresses unless you can get one for $15.  I doubt one of these would last one whole season if it were used and washed at least 2X per month.Oh, one last thing to note.  This dress will require hand washing, line drying, and a cool iron because it wrinkles very badly.  If you wash this in the washing machine with mild soap on the gentlest cycle, I think it would come apart in as little as 2-3 washings.  It may come apart in as little as 2-3 washings even if you wash by hand.  This is a HIGH MAINTENANCE dress that even with great care is not likely to last even one season.",EXTREMELY THIN MATERIAL --- Needs Slip/Pantaloons/Tights to be Wearable --- High Maintenance,2021-10-14,2.0

It technically 'fit' but lay in such a way that it wasn't going to be wearable without wearing a chemise underneath, or maybe adding a snap, or maybe both, and certainly generally reworking the bustline, and for the price that just felt like way too much work. It might have worked better on someone a little taller (I'm 5'3""), because it might have just laid nicer if you had a few extra inches.It is also very lightweight fabric. One of the reviewers mentioned this, and whatever you think the lightweight is, it's probably lighter than you were expecting. It would work fine over a slip, or possibly as a summer beach dress. It didn't seem particularly sheer to me in this color (at least not in the house), but it was a very light weight fabric.The color was fantastic, the overall dress just wasn't a match for me.","Good silhouette, but very lightweight fabric",2023-07-09,3.0

It's comfy, easy to wear/wears well, and the colors are fun! I recently put on some weight and bought this dress to have as a ""throw and go"" outfit that also would hide a multitude of sins. My only minor issue is that the pockets are high up for me. I'm over 5'7"" and find the placement a bit awkward, not just for reaching in and out, but keeping things in the pockets when I bend. My phone falls out every time. I suspect it's designed for shorter/smaller people. I wouldn't call it a ""mini"" dress but it's close as it hits me around mid upper-thigh. The fabric seems to be a kind of jersey, so it has a bit of weight and stretch/give. It's held up well through washing so far -and is mainly wrinkle free, even when it's been in a ball in my gym bag it falls nicely when I put it on. No sign of pilling or fading yet - the colors/pattern seem to be printed on rather than dyed directly into the fabric as the inside is white. This, I suppose, would make each sized dress look a little different depending on how much of the printed material is used. My dress is a large and there is more white than the dress pictured on the model, particularly towards the bottom. I would def buy again.","easy wear, easy care...and looks great",2023-09-18,5.0,R16MFC7NSINQS1,Maggie07,8.0,"EDIT:  see review below for how different colors fared as far as size. I got more and  I list them below.I got this dress in several colors and even though all were size large the actual size varied. When they got it right it was terrific but only one out of three fit.  If I were reviewing only the  201csunflower 201d pattern/color it would be five stars.  That one drapes beautifully, hits my 5 20192 201d frame just at the knee in front, about an inch lower in the back which makes bending over safe!  The 1971 style sunflower pattern ought to be terrible but it looks amazing.  Surprise!  Fits well under the arms and A-lines down over my hips, plus pockets!  BUT I got the same dress in  201cvintage paintings 201d  and while the pattern is great, it was a full size larger! It was like a tent on me and fell mid knee 2026so overall a size up.  The size tag was in a different place and tacked loosely on so perhaps it was a mix up.  But today I got the same dress in  201cgreen/white paint 201d. It 2019s also baggy and about a half size bigger than the sunflower dress.  Not a flattering fit. In the photo I have that behind the sunflower dress and hopefully you can see about a half inch to an inch or so excess fabric on the green/white one.  That one also was boxy and didn 2019t hang like the sunflower one.  I had this issue with this company in sleeveless dresses too.  When they get it right it 2019s amazing but there is such variation in sizing and fit.  One other note on the green/white. Despite it being listed as green it 2019s more an aqua or warmer toned blue with white and a few spring green details.  Pretty colors on all the dresses but fit varies so widely!  I have one more coming and will edit this review when it arrives.Edit. I got the green Star one and it is lovely.  Fit only slight large, hits mid knee, and flows very well. A keeper.In the same order I got the newsprint one.  It 2019s huge.  Fits like an XL and falls below the knee.  This one also had the size tag on the back of the neckline.  All the huge ones did.  The ones that fit better had the size tag on the side with the card instructions.  Can I assume they are made in different factories?  Also the newsprint one had one panel of fabric upside down from the other  d83d de15I put in to exchange it for a medium (I 2019m normally a size 12 and a large) and we will see if that works.

But I was disappointed and have to return them. I ordered the white blue floral and navy white floral in medium and they did fit (I'm 5'3"", 128 lbs).Both dresses had an issue with the snap on the chest. I didn't have any problems with them coming unsnapped, as others have reported, but the snaps were both sewn too close to the edge of the seam and even though mine weren't pulling the fabric AT ALL, the snap was clearly visible. It's metal and shiny and catches your eye. This makes the dress look unacceptably cheap and I would have been embarrassed to wear them in public.Also, the navy white floral dress had an issue with the bodice. The front right side clearly had too much fabric compared to the left (uneven) and that caused it to gap open between the snap and the belt area. The other dress had a matching amount of fabric on both sides, so this is just a quality control issue.I  have a 34DD bust and the last thing I need is for something to add volume underneath.  There are three different styles of dresses that can be ordered - you can tell the difference by looking at the sleeve in the picture of the one(s) you choose. I chose these because they had the longest sleeve and would provide coverage for my upper arms. Unfortunately, the bottom of the sleeve fell exactly at the widest part of the bust, making the whole area look even larger, which wasn't flattering to me. The loose material under the bust is not at all slimming for large-busted women. I thought I looked much slimmer after taking off the dress! I think this particular style would look much nicer on small-busted women (like the models in the photos).Some people complained about the unfinished seam on the hem. I was worried about that, but on the floral dresses I ordered, it was not noticeable and not a problem.  On the plus side, the fabric was very lightweight and cool, and the dresses both had a built-in slip that was attached inside by a thread, a nice touch. If a gust of wind blew the skirt open, you would not need to worry about modesty. I did love the bottom half of the dress and the slit was nicely made and very pretty.",Maybe not for large-busted; sewing and quality control issues,2023-06-20,2.0

But with two of the finest British actors ever, I had to watch this movie. Amazon's teaser describes it as ""wickedly funny and moving,"" but having seen the stage play years ago, I expected it to be more moving than funny, at least for me, and it was.McKellen is such a master at finding a fresh way to portray a character that still feels right, still feels like the character you've seen or read about before, only better, more multi-dimensional, but never overdone. The most diverse actor I can think of, McKellen can play anything from a clock (Beauty and the Beast) to a murderer (DaVinci Code). Here, there's a lot of diversity in one role, Norman. He pampers and cajoles his actor/boss, ""Sir,"" like a nursemaid. He threatens a young woman with violence and blackmail in order to protect Sir. Norman suffers so much pain because he wanted to act, but was never given the chance. He lives through Sir, grabbing a crumb of fulfillment here and there, as by his ability to recite any line in any Shakespearian play when Sir needs reminding. Yet Norman is insecure about making a simple pre-curtain announcement to the audience. In my opinion, Norman rivals Dickens' character Bradley Headstone for pathos, and is ideal for someone of McKellen's talent.Hopkins' Sir is 500% convincing as a man who is self-centered to the point of sociopathy. And now, the sociopath has dementia on top of it all! (And I wasn't just convinced because, sometimes, I looked at Sir's and saw Hannibal Lecter.) You don't like Sir, he infuriates you, yet you still feel sorry for him.The supporting actors are superb. I'd write more about them, but this is too long already.",These two couldn't miss,2018-06-10,5.0,R8SSRJMG5MYUX,Concerned About Movies,7.0,"I made the mistake of ordering the Blu-ray of this movie, but I'll probably return it. After noticing that the picture quality seemed no better than a regular DVD, I checked the disc. Sure enough, no Blu-ray symbol on the disc although the snap-case was clearly labled ""Blu-ray Disc"". Am I the only one this has happened to? Also, there is no menu on my disc and no extras. I tried everything to find a menu and/or a popup menu and/or subtitles and/or anything in addition to the movie, but couldn't ferret out anything. Despite this the back of the case clearly states that the disc contains ""Special Features --- 'From Stage to Screen' and 'Master & Assistant'."" To add insult to injury, the DVD looks suspiciously like a DVD-R, not a commercially produced DVD.As for this TV adaptation of the play ""The Dresser"", I don't think it holds up when compared to the 1983 movie adaptation starring Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. First of all, it seems to me that Ian McKellen was miscast as the dresser and, for the most part, I felt Anthony Hopkins failed to portray his character with the needed imperious yet vulnerable gravitas to make him both compelling and sympathetic. Don't get me wrong, I think both McKellen and Hopkins are both superb actors. But superb actors aren't necessarily superb in all parts. McKellen, especially, seemed to be unsuitable for his role. He does something with his voice that made a great deal of his dialogue unintelligible to this American, and his mincing around seemed to be a caricature of the person he played, rather than part of his identity. But Courtenay, in the 1983 movie adaptation, is spot on and completely believable. Every one of his lines (which are perfectly intelligible, by the way), and each one of his gestures, are impeccably interpreted and absolutely convincing.Ronald Harwood, who wrote the original play, actually was a dresser for the Shakespearean actor Sir Donald Wolfit upon whom Harwood based his play. Sir Wolfit's acting style on stage would undoubtedly be considered histrionic and hammy today, but it was an accepted convention and he was considered one of the finest Shakespearean actors of his time. Unlike Hopkins, Albert Finney captured that dated acting style perfectly when his character performed on stage. Also, unlike Hopkins, Finney's labored breathing and baleful sweating portrayed the actor as being dangerously infirm and on the verge of a heart attack throughout the movie. When Finney's character succumbs at the end of the movie it seems so poignant because we know that a great, but very flawed light has finally been extinguished and those who have been living in his shadow will now have to find their way in darkness. Hopkins, on the other hand, does sweat a lot but seemingly from exertion rather than from bad health, and his death at the end appeared to me to be more of a whimper than a gut-wrenching bang.The 1983 movie version was expanded to include scenes outside of the theater, and the play's dialogue was tightened. It was a ""movie version"" of the play, rather than the ""filmed play"" that we have here. Because it wasn't constrained to just the theater, I found the Finney / Courtenay adaptation to be more visually interesting. And personally, in this new Hopkins / McKellen adaptation I found the spacious dressing room of the star in this aging provincial theater to be improbable and distracting, given what little I know of British theater backstages. It appeared to be more like the set of stage play (which, I think, it was) rather than a real place. But perhaps I'm now swatting at gnats.However, the one really bright spot in this new movie adaptation is toward the end when Edward Fox (who plays Thornton) gives a moving speech to Hopkins. With the weight of forsakened dreams on his shoulders, Fox delivers each line, each word, with an underplayed and restrained emotion that tugs at your heart. Unfortunately, the film's editor kept cutting back to Hopkins during Fox's speech so, I suspect, we could see the effect the speech was having on ""Sir"". But at that point I didn't care, and I almost screamed at my television, ""Keep the dang camera on Fox for heaven's sake!"" For my money Edward Fox, who played a different part in the 1983 movie version, steals the whole show in that all-too-short scene and proves that ""there are no small parts, just small actors."" What a performance!I admit these are the mad ramblings of a non-professional critic. Take them for what they're worth. But my recommendation is that you buy the 1983 movieThe Dresser and skip this version. If you do decide to spend your hard earned money on this version, don't buy the Blu-ray",This Adaptation Was Okay But Uninspired.,2016-08-03,3.0

Will wear it for church and for special occasions.  The bodice has a snap, two more snaps were provided to secure more of the V neckline; which is good because it is too low for me.  The fabric is delicate though not see through; it is lined on the bodice and has a knee length lining, as well.  The long sleeves are not lined; there is a fabric belt made of the same fabric.  The print is lovely.  This dress has a nice fuller skirt, which will fit curvy women.  The print is lovely and feminine.  The workmanship is excellent.  I am rather particular about quality, this dress did not disappoint.The dress I chose has a dominant purple color.  It also comes in a different shade, the dominant color is a red-orange color; also an attractive color.  Though I did not know it, I saw a picture of one of my cousins wearing the dress she purchased  in the second red-orange color.Also, I happened to buy this dress when it was on sale.",Pretty Garden Dress,2023-09-16,5.0,R21RWUJHJZIG92,Kima513,3.0,"The Good; It's classic, soft, and comfortable. It fit exactly like a 1x would normally fit me (I ordered an XXL). I love the peacock blue color. For me it's a great shade without being too obnoxious.However I had two big issues with it.#1The v neck was a huge problem for me. It showed major major cleavage, to the point were it was insanely inappropriate. I could not wear it without an undershirt because it showed so much. However I do have a very large bust line (42 DD in a full coverage bra) and I could see how that was part of the problem. I don't know if the cleavage would be that intense with a smaller chest. There is a little button you can fasten to make it more modest. On me this button aggressively popped open with the slightest movement and I eventually stopped trying.  This left me with a silver button on one side of the neckline that wasn't horrible, but just looked weird.If you have smaller boobs or don't mind showing cleavage (lots of it)  than this probably wouldn't be an issue for you. For me, it was too much.#2 The dress has a sewn in slip. It's one of those that is shorter than the rest of the dress. It didn't seem to matter at first but when I sat down the slip rode up immediately. Every time I moved, it would ride up more. It was really bad. Like seriously.... REALLY bad. I tried to pull it down, but it was nearly impossible while sitting and was also just embarrassing.There was no way to try to fix it and look classy. It got so bad that I eventually had to grab a scarf (thank God I had one) and cover my legs with it. At one point the entire slip was bunched up around my waist and not covering even a millimeter of my legs. Since the top layer of the dress is see through this was a huge embarrassment. If it wouldn't have been for the scarf I would have had to leave.Maybe it's because I move more than the normal person, or am somehow a freak...? But wearing this dress was a horrible experience for me. I'm not willing to spend $50 on a dress that needs multiple add ons (undershirt, extra slip, blanket)  to make it work so I sent it back.",Loved Until I Wore It,2023-06-28,2.0

The dress is soft, flattering, and pretty good quality.",Beautiful and flattering,2023-09-11,4.0,R3NQIX8LZGTU1S,Suzy S,3.0,"I was so excited to receive these dresses because I needed something to wear while visiting a super hot climate area. But I was disappointed and have to return them. I ordered the white blue floral and navy white floral in medium and they did fit (I'm 5'3"", 128 lbs).Both dresses had an issue with the snap on the chest. I didn't have any problems with them coming unsnapped, as others have reported, but the snaps were both sewn too close to the edge of the seam and even though mine weren't pulling the fabric AT ALL, the snap was clearly visible. It's metal and shiny and catches your eye. This makes the dress look unacceptably cheap and I would have been embarrassed to wear them in public.Also, the navy white floral dress had an issue with the bodice. The front right side clearly had too much fabric compared to the left (uneven) and that caused it to gap open between the snap and the belt area. The other dress had a matching amount of fabric on both sides, so this is just a quality control issue.I  have a 34DD bust and the last thing I need is for something to add volume underneath.  There are three different styles of dresses that can be ordered - you can tell the difference by looking at the sleeve in the picture of the one(s) you choose. I chose these because they had the longest sleeve and would provide coverage for my upper arms. Unfortunately, the bottom of the sleeve fell exactly at the widest part of the bust, making the whole area look even larger, which wasn't flattering to me. The loose material under the bust is not at all slimming for large-busted women. I thought I looked much slimmer after taking off the dress! I think this particular style would look much nicer on small-busted women (like the models in the photos).Some people complained about the unfinished seam on the hem. I was worried about that, but on the floral dresses I ordered, it was not noticeable and not a problem.  On the plus side, the fabric was very lightweight and cool, and the dresses both had a built-in slip that was attached inside by a thread, a nice touch. If a gust of wind blew the skirt open, you would not need to worry about modesty. I did love the bottom half of the dress and the slit was nicely made and very pretty.",Maybe not for large-busted; sewing and quality control issues,2023-06-20,2.0

The fabric is really light and flowy so definitely watch out when the wind is blowing. It came down to around my knees/calves so it's a great length.

It technically 'fit' but lay in such a way that it wasn't going to be wearable without wearing a chemise underneath, or maybe adding a snap, or maybe both, and certainly generally reworking the bustline, and for the price that just felt like way too much work. It might have worked better on someone a little taller (I'm 5'3""), because it might have just laid nicer if you had a few extra inches.It is also very lightweight fabric. One of the reviewers mentioned this, and whatever you think the lightweight is, it's probably lighter than you were expecting. It would work fine over a slip, or possibly as a summer beach dress. It didn't seem particularly sheer to me in this color (at least not in the house), but it was a very light weight fabric.The color was fantastic, the overall dress just wasn't a match for me.","Good silhouette, but very lightweight fabric",2023-07-09,3.0

I chose these because they had the longest sleeve and would provide coverage for my upper arms. Unfortunately, the bottom of the sleeve fell exactly at the widest part of the bust, making the whole area look even larger, which wasn't flattering to me. The loose material under the bust is not at all slimming for large-busted women. I thought I looked much slimmer after taking off the dress! I think this particular style would look much nicer on small-busted women (like the models in the photos).Some people complained about the unfinished seam on the hem. I was worried about that, but on the floral dresses I ordered, it was not noticeable and not a problem.  On the plus side, the fabric was very lightweight and cool, and the dresses both had a built-in slip that was attached inside by a thread, a nice touch. If a gust of wind blew the skirt open, you would not need to worry about modesty. I did love the bottom half of the dress and the slit was nicely made and very pretty.",Maybe not for large-busted; sewing and quality control issues,2023-06-20,2.0

Mine (in black) did not shrink that I could tell with machine wash and dry; I removed it from the dryer while still warm and it isn't wrinkled at all. Quality after laundering seems to be all okay with no seams raveling.Quality seems fine though I haven't laundered it yet. The drawstring doesn't operate properly for 2 reasons: there is a piece of elastic alongside (and attached to) the drawstring in the back plus the fabric of the dress and drawstring has too much friction for the drawstring to slide properly. Even when I did take the time (hassle) to work the gathering enough to match my waist (big butt, small waist) there was no way to get it positioned right in the back because the attached elastic would stretch and prevented the drawstring to slide.I could tell that it wouldn't be flattering on me using the drawstring - as some other reviewers have noted.I decided to remove the drawstring altogether to make more of an A-line shift and found that the drawstring and elastic was tacked at the center back. Ok...carefully removed the stitching that tacked it then found that the elastic portion was (I think) sewed into the side seam on one side. Not willing to open up the side seam so I pulled drawstring and elastic out as far as possible to each side and cut it in the middle. I was able to get both ends of the drawstring completely out but there is still some of the elastic inside the casing in the back.I won't have a final verdict until after laundering so will come back here then.",ok but not grt if you want to remove the drawstring; not good (for me) using the drawstring either!,2023-07-27,4.0,R2ELGQ3HOLVOG5,L  Willis,0.0,"I 2019m very short waisted.

Everything I have ordered for my partner, my daughter, or myself, from them has been of the utmost quality. Love chiffon, of course. The skirt length is just a touch too long for me, but of course, my outrageously long torso is probably to blame. The sleeves and last ten inches of skirt are just the translucent chiffon, black, with gold polka dots. The rest is lined with an opaque black material, that feels wonderful inside. The belt is unsurprisingly high quality, as is the collar button on the back side.

Also, the fabric to me is just two levels above Halloween costume material, as is the stitching.  If the light hits it just right you can see a bit of the silhouette of your legs. At first glance it looks like nice fabric, but when you look closer it's...hmmm....which is too bad because I would pay a bit more for better fabric and stitching because the style is so great.

It had a slight empire waist and I thought that would be good to hide my big fat stomach.  But, I was wrong about that.  There I was in Spain to celebrate my sister 2019s 50th wedding anniversary standing with my green dress and my cross body purse, which hit just under my stomach.  It highlighted and emphasized my big fat paunch.  But, hey 203c!  That 2019s not the dress 2019s fault.  I should just stop stuffing my mouth with food for a minute.  Yeah 2026let 2019s be realistic about this.  That 2019s not happening.  Well, going on with my story.  I was walking on the promenade in Santander with my nephews and nieces.  I had thought it would be a good idea to stock up on some red wine for the main celebration the next day.  So, I bought three bottles of red wine at the grocery store and had them in a plastic supermarket bag.  I sat for a while and placed the plastic bag on the ground.  When I got up and reached for the bag, somehow the bag turned sideways and one of the bottles broke.  There I was with the broken bottle (still in the plastic bag) spilling wine all over the ground, through the plastic bag.  I brought it over to the closest trash can, dribbling red blood wine all the way on the ground and on me.  When I went to remove the bottle from the bag and toss it, it spritzed red wine all over the front of my green dress.  Yikes 203c!  I figured, this is never going to come out.  This has happened with red wine before and it 2019s very difficult to remove.  The only way I 2019ve been successful in removing it was with club soda, which I didn 2019t have.  So, when we returned to the villa where we were staying, I dabbed just plain water all over the front of my dress with no real expectations.  Wow 203c!  The stain completely disappeared after it dried.  My goodness, I thought, this can 2019t be real wine with the usual ingredients.  I figured it was an inferior wine, lacking all the true qualities of good red wine.The same night, I decided to open one of the bottles to have some wine with dinner.  Yes, a precursor to our celebration the next day.  I brought it over to the counter, got the wine cork opener, and went at it.  The top of the bottle (the glass neck) totally broke off along with the cork in it.  Of course, it spilled all over the green dress again.  Oh, my God 203c!  This poor dress is jinxed 203c!  I dabbed plain water on it again (yeah, this is getting to be a constant habit) and lo and behold, it once again came out totally.Well, I 2019m back in the States now and needed something a little less casual than the slacks I 2019ve been wearing to work.  So, off to the green dress.  Ugggh.  It was so badly wrinkled.  I hate to iron.  So, I hung it on a hanger with some clothes pins to hold it in place and hung it in the shower with the water on hot.  Several minutes later, the dress was ready for wear.  I threw it on.  Ummph 203c!  It 2019s still damp 203c  oh, well, it will dry soon enough.  Off to work.In the middle of the morning I went to the coffee station.  I shouldn 2019t have coffee due to a strict diet I 2019ve been on.  But, I really wanted it.  So, I brewed it (in a machine that does it for you, of course) and added some almond milk (that makes my having it in the first place better in my own head) and got the lid to place on the top.  But, unfortunately, it was a defective lid.  And half of it was smashed and raised.  This will never do.  I went to remove the lid to replace it with a non-defective lid and the coffee splashed all over the front of my green dress.  What a total surprise, right?  Right there and then, I got one of those paper towels, saturated it with plain water and dabbed the whole front of my dress.  And, yes, I had to walk back to my desk with my entire front of the dress wet from the water.  It was very attractive.  I figured I would have a really nasty stain from the coffee as I have always had with coffee (I can never remove the stains).  I figured,  201cwell, that 2019s it for the poor green dress.  It certainly has travelled, though. 201d  When it dried, the stain was totally gone.   201cWHAT??? 201d  What 2019s going on with this dress???  I even went into the ladies 2019 room to inspect it in the full length mirror.  No, I wasn 2019t imagining it, the stain is totally gone.  It 2019s pure magic.  A truly magic dress.I may attempt to get another identical dress, but in a different color.  But, you know what?  I don 2019t think I will ever find a second Magic Dress.

It is the same rather thin fabric. But I have determined it is good in hot weather. Between the larger size and very dark colour, the wine red dress is totally opaque. (I felt the lighter coloured leopard print had a potentiel to show my bra, depending on the colour, especially if it was any tighter over the chest. It didn't, though.)Regarding the colour, please note that it is more burgundy than red, cool and deep, almost shading into aubergine. It's all right on me because I am a former brunette (my hair is now naturally grey), but the colour might be a bit dark and heavy on a blonde or redhead. Of course, it depends on your taste, but I thought the colour looked much lighter and redder in the pictures than it does in real life.I really think L was my size, but I do appreciate the additional looseness in the hips and waist areas afforded by the XL, as well as the additional length. I am 5'10"", and the L is an above-the-ankle dress, when the XL is ankle length, in flats, which is how I will mostly wear them. The top part is quite loose. The arm holes are deep and loose and the bust is loose as well. I have broad shoulders, a very large rib cage and a medium-sized bosom (C cup), plus biggish arms (think middle-aged swimmer), so it is unusual for me to find clothes are too big on top. I think you should bear that in mind for sizing. If, like me, you want the dress to be non-clingy around the waist and stomach, it may be challenging to get a good fit unless you have a very full chest. Indeed, I think I will try this with a padded bra next time.The price point is sort of middle-of-the-road and so are the dresses. I think they will hold up well; others I had in this brand did and I have washed and worn the leopard dress maybe four times now and the wine one once with no noticeable changes whatsoever. They are not thrilling dresses, but they are serviceable and handy, especially in a hot climate (and I live in Africa). They could have been better, and I am surprised by the fit, but overall, I am happy with my purchases and will wear them often. I like that the skirt is a bit wider on the bottom and doesn't have a slit. It is easy to walk in (I have a long stride and can't stand a skirt that hobbles my gait), and the fact it doesn't have a slit means I don't have to worry about a slip showing underneath.Leopard Print LThis dress is one I am going to keep, but I think I will mostly wear it under a jean jacket. This dress has several minor issues. The material is thinner and more polyester-like than expected. It is not see-through, however, despite the light-coloured base. The beige shade is deeper and warmer than expected, which may be nice for some, but is not very good for me (I have grey hair and was expecting more of an ecru, it's almost a tan). Above all, it is clingy without being tight. The material just sticks to any lumps or bumps. I could literally see the outline of the elastic on my panties. Not an indent, because they're not tight, but the actual top and bottom of the elastic. And it pointed out the little pooch and the little pouch in my midsection. Thankfully the skirt is a little looser, it's an A-line style, so I didn't see anything on my lower hips. I admit I haven't tried it with a slip and might play around with different underwear options. If I were a Spanx wearer, it would be lovely, but I don't do that... if I can find a cool shift to put underneath, it might smooth things out. We'll see...Update a week later: This dress is growing on me. The colour is all right. The thin fabric makes it cooler in this stifling heat. I haven't found a shift, but I've worn a half slip. You can see the little line around my waist, but it's not the end of the world, as you can see, I'm obviously not going to be on any catwalks any time soon. Great dress for wearing around the house, and will probably look cute under my jean jacket in cooler weather.Further update: tried it with loose tap pants and it was all the dress needed for modesty and very cool and comfortable.",The fabric is a tad bit thin... size up if you don't mind it being loose in chest and armpits,2022-06-08,4.0,R3OOQFZN895K79,Evette Shaffer,0.0,Dress fits true to size but smells strongly of incense.

I believed the little white design in the dress was little flowers, when I received it, I realized it is kind of like a cheetah print.  Still pretty; however, the description says a floral boho dress and the woman pictured is holding flowers.  The dress is soft, flattering, and pretty good quality.",Beautiful and flattering,2023-09-11,4.0,R3NQIX8LZGTU1S,Suzy S,3.0,"I was so excited to receive these dresses because I needed something to wear while visiting a super hot climate area. But I was disappointed and have to return them. I ordered the white blue floral and navy white floral in medium and they did fit (I'm 5'3"", 128 lbs).Both dresses had an issue with the snap on the chest. I didn't have any problems with them coming unsnapped, as others have reported, but the snaps were both sewn too close to the edge of the seam and even though mine weren't pulling the fabric AT ALL, the snap was clearly visible. It's metal and shiny and catches your eye. This makes the dress look unacceptably cheap and I would have been embarrassed to wear them in public.Also, the navy white floral dress had an issue with the bodice. The front right side clearly had too much fabric compared to the left (uneven) and that caused it to gap open between the snap and the belt area. The other dress had a matching amount of fabric on both sides, so this is just a quality control issue.I  have a 34DD bust and the last thing I need is for something to add volume underneath.  There are three different styles of dresses that can be ordered - you can tell the difference by looking at the sleeve in the picture of the one(s) you choose. I chose these because they had the longest sleeve and would provide coverage for my upper arms. Unfortunately, the bottom of the sleeve fell exactly at the widest part of the bust, making the whole area look even larger, which wasn't flattering to me. The loose material under the bust is not at all slimming for large-busted women. I thought I looked much slimmer after taking off the dress! I think this particular style would look much nicer on small-busted women (like the models in the photos).Some people complained about the unfinished seam on the hem. I was worried about that, but on the floral dresses I ordered, it was not noticeable and not a problem.  On the plus side, the fabric was very lightweight and cool, and the dresses both had a built-in slip that was attached inside by a thread, a nice touch. If a gust of wind blew the skirt open, you would not need to worry about modesty. I did love the bottom half of the dress and the slit was nicely made and very pretty.",Maybe not for large-busted; sewing and quality control issues,2023-06-20,2.0

I have actually purchased four of them in different colors, and I plan on purchasing more as long as the company keeps their price point at a reasonable rate as they have been doing. This is so smart of them to do this, because they actually sell more of these dresses than the ones that cost so much more. I absolutely will not buy others due to the ridiculous cost. These are made exceptionally well and are just so attractive on me. Every time I wear one I get multiple compliments, even from strangers at the grocery store. I have washed them multiple times on a cool gentle cycle and hung them to dry and they come out perfectly.  The buttons are metal and the only part of the dress that I might consider changing, as the metal buttons look kind of cheap on the dark solid colors, but are not even noticeable on the ones with a printed pattern. They can be dressed up with jewelry and a pretty sweater and the material is a nice quality and cool in the summer. I actually will wear some of these as the weather cools down with a warmer sweater and some boots. I haven 2019t had any problems with the fabric being thin or see through. They are fine in this respect. You need to purchase one of these dresses. You won 2019t be disappointed. I hope that this company continues to make these and keeps the pricing reasonable, so over time I can purchase more of them in different colors. I would not do this if they hiked the price way up. It would also be nice if they had a long sleeve version of this dress for winter or even more options with short sleeves, instead of sleeveless. Thanks to this dress, I have actually felt beautiful when I wear it and that is such a great feeling.Addendum: I read some other reviews about a seam ripping in this dress. I think if you just carelessly throw this in the washer with other clothes then they will put too much tension on these areas since this dress is longer than most dresses. The material for me is perfect, but lightweight which is great for the summer. If you wash it by itself on a cold water gentle cycle and hang it to dry then it should be fine. I have worn one of mine now at least 20 times and it still looks brand new. I love it so much that I take the extra precautions to keep it perfect.

With a fair bit of international travel under my belt having one of those saves on space and items as well as being modest and comfortable.  No, this is not the demnin because I've given up finding what I want.This dress seemed like a reasonable alternative.  Here is the breakdown of pro/con.Pro: Comfortable,  lightweight, has pockets (a BIG plus). It probably can handle a thin short sleeve top if needed (not an item in my wardrobe right now). I have kimono style cover ups that will work just fine.Con: Gaps in underarm (easily fixed). Price is a bit high IMHO.  This next point may just be buyer beware.  My issue is color. I bought the navy blue but am hard pressed to know if it is navy or black.  I had a similar problem with two J.Jill purchases of black and navy slacks. I had to write with permanent marker to be able to distinguish one from the other.  Just had my son weigh in and he said black and had a similar issue with Carhartt once.  Odds are whoever pulled it couldn't tell the difference either.Bottom Line? That's up to you. If they had a denim blue I'd buy again.  It hasn't been washed yet so that is a wait and see.P. S.

My skin breaks down easily - and if I start sweating I easily develop skin infections.  My doctor wants me to wear very loose clothing with no underwear when it gets hot or if I'm doing work that causes me to sweat.  So this looked like the perfect garment - 100% USA grown cotton.  I was initially unhappy as hell when I opened the package and put the dress on.  But I decided to just try wearing it a bit.  I'm 5'3"" and about 118 pounds and I ordered a medium.  It was super baggy around the neck and fit like a girdle around my waist and hips.  After I had it on a couple of hours, the dress started fitting me much better.  It was loose around my waist and the bagginess around my neck was still there but was not a problem (I'm very narrow from shoulder to shoulder).  It is worth the money and it will be great for what I need it for.  HOWEVER, I'd be willing to pay more if they would put on-seam pockets (at least one pocket large enough for my phone).  Also, it would be nice if they had some patterned fabric because it is next to impossible to keep a solid color clean.  For now I am wearing an apron with pockets over it.  But I think I will start making my own dresses like this with pockets and using a patterned material.  Also, for a solid color, basic black would be an easier color to keep clean.

The tan one fared best because of its light color.I have not worn or washed the fifth one (red with white flowers). I don't like this one as much. It's tomato red and the big flowers feel cartoonish, almost like Minnie Mouse. But I might try hand-washing from now on.

I believed the little white design in the dress was little flowers, when I received it, I realized it is kind of like a cheetah print.  Still pretty; however, the description says a floral boho dress and the woman pictured is holding flowers.  The dress is soft, flattering, and pretty good quality.",Beautiful and flattering,2023-09-11,4.0,R3NQIX8LZGTU1S,Suzy S,3.0,"I was so excited to receive these dresses because I needed something to wear while visiting a super hot climate area. But I was disappointed and have to return them. I ordered the white blue floral and navy white floral in medium and they did fit (I'm 5'3"", 128 lbs).Both dresses had an issue with the snap on the chest. I didn't have any problems with them coming unsnapped, as others have reported, but the snaps were both sewn too close to the edge of the seam and even though mine weren't pulling the fabric AT ALL, the snap was clearly visible. It's metal and shiny and catches your eye. This makes the dress look unacceptably cheap and I would have been embarrassed to wear them in public.Also, the navy white floral dress had an issue with the bodice. The front right side clearly had too much fabric compared to the left (uneven) and that caused it to gap open between the snap and the belt area. The other dress had a matching amount of fabric on both sides, so this is just a quality control issue.I  have a 34DD bust and the last thing I need is for something to add volume underneath.  There are three different styles of dresses that can be ordered - you can tell the difference by looking at the sleeve in the picture of the one(s) you choose. I chose these because they had the longest sleeve and would provide coverage for my upper arms. Unfortunately, the bottom of the sleeve fell exactly at the widest part of the bust, making the whole area look even larger, which wasn't flattering to me. The loose material under the bust is not at all slimming for large-busted women. I thought I looked much slimmer after taking off the dress! I think this particular style would look much nicer on small-busted women (like the models in the photos).Some people complained about the unfinished seam on the hem. I was worried about that, but on the floral dresses I ordered, it was not noticeable and not a problem.  On the plus side, the fabric was very lightweight and cool, and the dresses both had a built-in slip that was attached inside by a thread, a nice touch. If a gust of wind blew the skirt open, you would not need to worry about modesty. I did love the bottom half of the dress and the slit was nicely made and very pretty.",Maybe not for large-busted; sewing and quality control issues,2023-06-20,2.0

This dress is, without a doubt, overpriced.  I think the thing I dislike the most is that the picture is deceptive regarding the waistline. It could be freakin 2019 awesome and flattering if the waist fell where it does in the picture but it 2019s much higher than that so not as flattering. As mentioned in other reviews, the collar flops around. There is a very cute work around. You can easily tuck the sides in and, even better iron the sides of the collar all the way down into a v neck and it stays and it 2019s adorable.Some people said it wrinkles too easily but it really doesn 2019t. It just needs a quick steam after you wash it on cold and let it hang to dry. Now for the good stuff, the material is paper thin and very breathable but it 2019s good material and you feel adequately covered. The kind of material you don 2019t get all sweaty in on a hot day. It is perfect for taking kids to the splash pad on a hot day or really anything. You could wear it to the pool but you could also wear it to church. It 2019s that versatile. All in all, it 2019s a cute dress. I 2019m happy I bought it. I have it in burnt orange which is very vibrant and my husband likes it a lot. I also got it in the navy blue. It 2019s pretty. Just know it is the darkest, blackest blue I 2019ve ever seen. We had to hold it under the light to make sure it really is blue. But i like it. The length is perfect. I don 2019t like too long but I want my knees well covered.  I am 5 20194 201d/175#. Hope this helps.  And, again, it doesn 2019t wrinkle easily, it just needs a quick once over after you wash it on cold and let it hang dry because there are fine faint wrinkles all over if you don 2019t.

I love the color, and the material isn't thin/ see-through.Since it is a knit, I knew it would stretch, but I was worried about the fit across my chest and back.  I am 5'8 and I wear a large, which is the size gifted to me.  The dress fit perfectly, including the length, which hit about mid-calf (not hardly as long as pictured on the model).The dress does have elastic, which I am not a huge fan of, just below the bust.  Because I carry a lot of weight in my abdomen, I often look pregnant in clothing that is more sinched under the breast.  This dress, even with the elastic, hangs beautifully and does not create that unflattering look on my middle-aged body.The dress also has pockets, which I absolutely love on a casual style dress.Not only will it be perfect for hot summer days, but I'll style it with my jean jacket this fall, so I'll get more wear out of it - hello versatility.","Flattering, comfortable sundress",2023-09-13,5.0,R30RRQ8OE3LNFN,Susan Can,1.0,"Ordered this dress after seeing a cute, tiered-style dress on a fashion reel and was excited for it to arrive.

My daughter said I looked like a kindergarten teacher and husband said I looked like I was taping an episode of Sister Wives. No judgement on kindergarten teachers or sister wives, but neither feedback was meant to be positive and I returned the dress.","Sister-wivesy, according to my husband.",2023-08-24,3.0

The rest of the dress was bulky and I had to have it altered to take out 1"" at waist on each side and 2"" at the bottom of the dress on the sides. COLOR: The blue was true to the picture. RUFFLES and TIES: The string was just yarn and had dangling balls. Yarn was white and gold and went ok with dress if I wore gold accessories. The top is covered with small balls that are a bit much but it would be easy to remove the yard and top balls.

I got enough compliments that day that I bought it again in pink, black, and light blue. I also ordered the red color but sent it back due to the waistband being sewn in a crooked angle in front so the buttons made a diagonal line at the waist. However, the other colors were made correctly.I agree about the buttons on some of the dresses. Not only poor quality, but against some colors they stood out too much and took over the dress. I solved that when I ordered better buttons and replaced them. I put lovely black with brass edge heart buttons on the black dress and dark rose heart buttons on the pink dress.  The other dresses were okay with the buttons that came on them although I may change them out too just for fun.  I also tacked down that snap at the bustline so it wouldn't pull.

All the others were true to the images on this page. However, as is the case with many Amazon-made (/sold) items, the quality of the material was sub-par.My only real issue with this dress is that of those 5 I ordered, three of them had necklines that looked stretched out, as though there was just too much material there (not as though they'd been worn before). One was so bad that I even thought about gathering the extra material at the very front of the neckline and sewing it to make an impromptu v-neck but didn't think that would look good since that part of the dress is so thin. It was frustrating - I thought I'd found a dress I really liked - good length, loved the pockets - but the neckline, which is impossible to hide or really adjust, just looked frumpy.

It does have pockets which is nice, but once again because of the fabric they do not allow the dress to lay flat. The dress has a little of a pucker/point in that area. Not my favorite summer dress.",Doesn't Flow as Expected,2023-09-01,3.0

I believed the little white design in the dress was little flowers, when I received it, I realized it is kind of like a cheetah print.  Still pretty; however, the description says a floral boho dress and the woman pictured is holding flowers.  The dress is soft, flattering, and pretty good quality.",Beautiful and flattering,2023-09-11,4.0,R3NQIX8LZGTU1S,Suzy S,3.0,"I was so excited to receive these dresses because I needed something to wear while visiting a super hot climate area. But I was disappointed and have to return them. I ordered the white blue floral and navy white floral in medium and they did fit (I'm 5'3"", 128 lbs).Both dresses had an issue with the snap on the chest. I didn't have any problems with them coming unsnapped, as others have reported, but the snaps were both sewn too close to the edge of the seam and even though mine weren't pulling the fabric AT ALL, the snap was clearly visible. It's metal and shiny and catches your eye. This makes the dress look unacceptably cheap and I would have been embarrassed to wear them in public.Also, the navy white floral dress had an issue with the bodice. The front right side clearly had too much fabric compared to the left (uneven) and that caused it to gap open between the snap and the belt area. The other dress had a matching amount of fabric on both sides, so this is just a quality control issue.I  have a 34DD bust and the last thing I need is for something to add volume underneath.  There are three different styles of dresses that can be ordered - you can tell the difference by looking at the sleeve in the picture of the one(s) you choose. I chose these because they had the longest sleeve and would provide coverage for my upper arms. Unfortunately, the bottom of the sleeve fell exactly at the widest part of the bust, making the whole area look even larger, which wasn't flattering to me. The loose material under the bust is not at all slimming for large-busted women. I thought I looked much slimmer after taking off the dress! I think this particular style would look much nicer on small-busted women (like the models in the photos).Some people complained about the unfinished seam on the hem. I was worried about that, but on the floral dresses I ordered, it was not noticeable and not a problem.  On the plus side, the fabric was very lightweight and cool, and the dresses both had a built-in slip that was attached inside by a thread, a nice touch. If a gust of wind blew the skirt open, you would not need to worry about modesty. I did love the bottom half of the dress and the slit was nicely made and very pretty.",Maybe not for large-busted; sewing and quality control issues,2023-06-20,2.0

Still pretty; however, the description says a floral boho dress and the woman pictured is holding flowers.  The dress is soft, flattering, and pretty good quality.",Beautiful and flattering,2023-09-11,4.0,R3NQIX8LZGTU1S,Suzy S,3.0,"I was so excited to receive these dresses because I needed something to wear while visiting a super hot climate area. But I was disappointed and have to return them. I ordered the white blue floral and navy white floral in medium and they did fit (I'm 5'3"", 128 lbs).Both dresses had an issue with the snap on the chest. I didn't have any problems with them coming unsnapped, as others have reported, but the snaps were both sewn too close to the edge of the seam and even though mine weren't pulling the fabric AT ALL, the snap was clearly visible. It's metal and shiny and catches your eye. This makes the dress look unacceptably cheap and I would have been embarrassed to wear them in public.Also, the navy white floral dress had an issue with the bodice. The front right side clearly had too much fabric compared to the left (uneven) and that caused it to gap open between the snap and the belt area. The other dress had a matching amount of fabric on both sides, so this is just a quality control issue.I  have a 34DD bust and the last thing I need is for something to add volume underneath.  There are three different styles of dresses that can be ordered - you can tell the difference by looking at the sleeve in the picture of the one(s) you choose. I chose these because they had the longest sleeve and would provide coverage for my upper arms. Unfortunately, the bottom of the sleeve fell exactly at the widest part of the bust, making the whole area look even larger, which wasn't flattering to me. The loose material under the bust is not at all slimming for large-busted women. I thought I looked much slimmer after taking off the dress! I think this particular style would look much nicer on small-busted women (like the models in the photos).Some people complained about the unfinished seam on the hem. I was worried about that, but on the floral dresses I ordered, it was not noticeable and not a problem.

I have actually purchased four of them in different colors, and I plan on purchasing more as long as the company keeps their price point at a reasonable rate as they have been doing. This is so smart of them to do this, because they actually sell more of these dresses than the ones that cost so much more. I absolutely will not buy others due to the ridiculous cost. These are made exceptionally well and are just so attractive on me. Every time I wear one I get multiple compliments, even from strangers at the grocery store. I have washed them multiple times on a cool gentle cycle and hung them to dry and they come out perfectly.  The buttons are metal and the only part of the dress that I might consider changing, as the metal buttons look kind of cheap on the dark solid colors, but are not even noticeable on the ones with a printed pattern. They can be dressed up with jewelry and a pretty sweater and the material is a nice quality and cool in the summer. I actually will wear some of these as the weather cools down with a warmer sweater and some boots. I haven 2019t had any problems with the fabric being thin or see through. They are fine in this respect. You need to purchase one of these dresses. You won 2019t be disappointed. I hope that this company continues to make these and keeps the pricing reasonable, so over time I can purchase more of them in different colors. I would not do this if they hiked the price way up. It would also be nice if they had a long sleeve version of this dress for winter or even more options with short sleeves, instead of sleeveless. Thanks to this dress, I have actually felt beautiful when I wear it and that is such a great feeling.Addendum: I read some other reviews about a seam ripping in this dress. I think if you just carelessly throw this in the washer with other clothes then they will put too much tension on these areas since this dress is longer than most dresses. The material for me is perfect, but lightweight which is great for the summer. If you wash it by itself on a cold water gentle cycle and hang it to dry then it should be fine. I have worn one of mine now at least 20 times and it still looks brand new. I love it so much that I take the extra precautions to keep it perfect.

I cannot see how one could workout or run in these shoes nor stand on their feet all day on a hard surface.  A short walk around the neighborhood or in the backyard is about all these can stand.  Full disclosure - I'm male about 200 lbs and need stability and support.  If you don't weigh much and just need walking around shoes, you may like them.

I knew I wanted something built with good materials that would last me several years, look good with a variety of different clothing options, and work well for a wide variety of activities including hiking, working out, walking around all day, etc., and also at a good price. I'm not a fan of spending tons of money on several different pairs of shoes tailored to each individual activity. I found a pair of these at a store and really liked how they looked and fit. My foot fits well in the size I purchased, and there is some arch support as well, but not overpowering. I've never has a pair of Merrell's before, but they're known for good quality and these shoes look and feel like good quality. They have real leather, thick tractiony soles, an agressive look, and tons of color options. I've worn them for a couple of weeks and they feel great. The best part was the price. At the store I tried them on at, they cost $120. Then I checked on Amazon and they had my size for under $60. I noticed the price was different depending on size, and possibly color, with some of them costing as much as $120. I'm not sure why this is. You might want to select different options before purchasing to see if one size or color is a better price. They are also probably a bit heavy for people that want something really light for running or working out, but for me it just makes my workout a little more challenging. It's not supposed to be easy, right? Other than that, there were a couple of other little issues I should mention. For some reason, the shoe I got looked like a lighter shade than what was pictured. Then I held the shoe up next to the picture, and they looked the same color. It may be that the pictures were taken under different lighting conditions that made them seem a bit darker, I don't know, but I've seen other reviews that say the color is different, and I thought so too until I held them right next to each other. A trick of the mind. The last issue is size, and this is the most important. I'm glad I tried them on at a store first, because I generally wear a 10-1/2, sometimes an 11. At the store I needed an 11-1/2, but they fit perfectly! I ordered an 11-1/2, and again they fit perfectly. So I would probably order one size large if you want them to fit. On a last note, I liked these so much that I ordered another pair of a different color. I felt like these were such a great shoe at such a great price, it was well worth it to have a second pair. These will probably last me a good 10 years between the two.",Great Shoe!,2023-07-27,5.0,R282PS7RDLK63Q,hstoner,3.0,"I generally have a hard time buying walking / hiking shoes, getting the fit right.

But the shoes were getting worn out, so I ordered a new pair of Moab 3s, exactly the same size 10M US.  Unfortunately I cannot know if shoes are going to fit well until I've walked 10 miles or so in them, and now that I have, I have new heel blisters that I haven't had for over a year.  They are definitely roomier and slip more in the heel than my old pair.  So I'm probably going to have to discard them and try something else new, which for me is another crap-shoot.

My experience with these shoes was quite a journey, and I'm excited to share my insights with you.Firstly, the aesthetics of these shoes are undeniably appealing. They embody a clean and sleek style that can effortlessly transition from a casual day out to a business meeting. The navy color adds a touch of sophistication that elevates any outfit.The comfort level of these shoes is commendable. They offer the snug fit of a sneaker while maintaining the professional look of a dress shoe. However, I would recommend swapping out the original laces for smoother ones to enhance the overall comfort.The craftsmanship of these shoes is noteworthy. The design, the stitching, and the overall build quality reflect a high level of attention to detail. Moreover, the price point is quite attractive, making these shoes a great value for money.However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are a few areas where these shoes could use some improvement.Pros:+ Stylish and versatile design: These shoes can easily transition between casual and professional settings.+ Comfort: They offer a level of comfort comparable to much more expensive shoes.+ Craftsmanship: The attention to detail and build quality are impressive.+ Price: They offer great value for money.Cons:- Color inconsistency: The grey color variant seems to resemble the blue one, which can be misleading.- Cushioning and arch support: The shoes could use more cushioning and better arch support. An insert might be necessary for extended wear.- Durability: Some users have reported issues with the upper part separating from the sole after a few months of use.- Heat retention: These shoes tend to retain heat, which might lead to sweaty feet after a few hours of wear.In conclusion, the Bruno Marc Men's Oxfords Sneakers Casual Dress Shoes are a stylish and affordable option for those seeking a versatile pair of shoes.

The first pair I ordered were too small and this pair little big. The first pair was not wide enough so I went with the wider size. I had rather have them little big than to small.

So I got these, and they are fine for what they cost. They are not perfect and I would recommend not using them under the same conditions I have, which is to say walk 5 miles a day in dusty, rocky terrain to and from work and stand for five hours in a greasy kitchen. I managed to get a quarter sized hole within 3 months. So I bought another pair.Hey, if you can find better under worse conditions, by all means go for those, but if I need shoes now for a little cheap, I'm not going to mind going for what I know. What I will say is that they are not terribly comfortable after a while, to the point I had to get some Dr. Scholls soles to make them more bearable. The default soles are glued in, so if you are going to change them out, you should know about that.These are okay if you need something and don't want to experiment, but I also notice the usual price is like $50, which I don't know if I can recommend under such conditions, but these seem to stay on sale at $30, so that's a price I recommend. In short, they're fine but they will need to be replaced if under enough pressure. They're good if you need something on a budget in a short time.",Buy for $30 or less,2023-06-29,3.0

My only complaint is that this is the first time I've found a pair of these shoes not as comfortable with the stock insole.

I dig the look and I plan to use them for walking, work, and general casual use. I wanted something that I could potentially wear all day without discomfort and these seem perfect for that.The build quality is good, not excellent. It uses a faux suede material around the eyelets that looks a bit cheap. The toe box uses a formed knitted material which doesn't seem to be especially breathable (my ""light test"" showed very little light getting through) but it looks nice. There's a reflective strip with the logo on it, which I like. Compared to my expensive Altra running shoes and my Reebok cross-trainers, those shoes rely more on plasticky bits held on with glue. The overall quality of the Whitins is not far off the mark. The rubberized sole might be the first thing to wear out, as it's not especially thick. But compare that to Skechers which often go with a cheaper, less durable foam sole, and the Whitin soles look durable by comparison.If you plan to run in these, keep in mind that these are zero-drop shoes and while they have padding, it's probably not enough for people who run on their heels. It's best for fore/midfoot runners.It's really impressive that you can get something that looks nice and feels this good on your feet for such a low price.Fit: I'd go 1-1.5 sizes down from your usual.

As a fan of both comfort and style, these shoes tick all the right boxes.First and foremost, the design is what caught my attention. The edgy yet sophisticated look of the Villain Shoes is perfect for those who want to make a statement with their footwear. The combination of textures and the signature DC logo give these shoes a distinct and modern appeal. They easily transition from casual outings to slightly dressier occasions, adding a touch of flair to any outfit.But it's not just about appearances. The comfort level of these shoes is truly impressive. The padded collar and cushioned insole provide excellent support, making these shoes a joy to wear even for extended periods. Whether I'm walking around the city or spending a day on my feet, my feet feel pampered and well-supported.Another noteworthy feature is the slip-on design. It's incredibly convenient and adds an element of ease to putting on and taking off the shoes. This feature has quickly made the Villain Shoes my go-to choice when I'm in a rush or simply looking for hassle-free footwear.Durability is always a concern with shoes, and I'm happy to report that these shoes have held up remarkably well. The quality craftsmanship is evident in every stitch and detail, ensuring that they withstand daily wear and tear without showing signs of deterioration.In terms of sizing, I found that the shoes run true to size.

I will probably have to return and look in a local store.One thing I did like was the stylist look.UPDATE: I ordered some arch support insoles and will try using them before deciding to return as I like the room in the toe area and the look of the shoe. Insoles make all the difference in a show. I am shocked how flimy the insoles are in shoes. Checked all my old shoes and they are all flat.

I have been thinking of ordering a brand name pair similar to these, but have never owed any double monk strap style shoes.

The box and packaging even exceeded expectations. There was a strange smell when I opened the box, but it dissipated pretty quickly.The shoes look amazing in person, especially considering the low price point. The upper is not leather, but most people would be able to tell just by glancing at them. The sole is rubber, which makes them comfortable to walk in. I will say, as far as new shoes go, these are some of the most comfortable dress shoes I have bought in a while that were this comfortable before even being broken in.I did not know how the strap system would work, so I was pleasantly surprised when I found that there was an elastic band paired to each strap, making these easier to get on and off. Getting them on can be a bit of a challenge at first, since they have to be tight enough to not slip off when you are walking. Just buy a cheap shoe horn for a few dollars and it will make it so much easier for you (not to mention, it helps prevents you from damaging the upper by twisting and jamming your foot in the shoe).I hope these shoes hold up for a while, because they look amazing and are sold at such a cheap price point.

I don 2019t know what some people do to their shoes, but a lot of people can wear out a pair of shoes in a few months. For me, it takes me years to wear out a pair of shoes. These are good looking shoes and they are super lightweight and very comfortable if you 2019re thinking of purchasing them go for it you 2019ll probably love them.",Finally,2023-08-24,5.0,R2HLSAU3WE76D0,Frizzy,1.0,"I'm pretty disappointed by these shoes. I bought them with the intent to go hiking around since my hiking shoes were getting worn out and I wanted to try out something lighter weight. After they arrived, I spent about a week breaking them in before going out on any hikes. Even after a week of break-in, the outsoles were still surprisingly stiff but I did like the lightness and breathability of the shoe.I take these out on a first easy hike (<1.5mi and less than 100ft elevation gain) and was not impressed at all. The grip is not good on even dry, flat rock. They seem okay on a soft path, but as soon as I encountered any wetness, the grip is poor. Wet rocks are dangerous with these shoes and I nearly fell a few times on that first easy hike just walking around.I'm not sure what Saucony means by ""Trail Running Shoe"", but I don't think they are suitable even as a ""trail walking shoe"". I wouldn't use these for anything that isn't on a paved path.I have since decided that these shoes are not to ever be used for hiking again and have relegated them to daily wear (office job) and the gym. They are okay for that purpose. After a month, the insoles and midsoles are still too stiff and do not offer much arc support. Standing around in these shoes gets my feet aching in 30 minutes or less. They are decent for the gym since they are lightweight and breathable.Overall, I would not recommend these shoes for any purpose. There are much better options out there.","Good looks, lightweight, and breathable, but many downsides",2023-07-17,3.0

I 2019m talking $300 plus for American made shoes.  They are recraftable (resole-able) for another $100 each time.But since Covid, I don 2019t go to the office as often.  One of my black dress shoes needs to be re-soled, and it will be.  Just not now.So I ran into these shoes on Amazon.  It 2019s hard to argue with the price.  Literally 10% of what I have been paying.  So, are these shoes 90% lower in quality?The short, simple answer is, surprisingly, no.  Just the opposite.Upon receipt, I inspected them carefully and they looked pretty darned decent.  I was looking for any excuse to plop them back in the box and return them.  I couldn 2019t find anything.I appreciate that the leather upper is smooth and mildly shiny.  This is a wing tip style shoe, so I 2019m impressed that the extensive stitching was evenly spaced.  The leather detailing that I expect on a wing tip is also all there.Inside the shoe, it is lined from the toes all the way to the heel box 2026 nice!  And that leather feels surprisingly supple.  That is something I would expect on a much more expensive shoe.  But definitely not at this price point.Hmm.I even liked the wax laces they chose.  They are a little thicker and have more than adequate length.  The shoe 2019s eyelets have interior facing metal grommets to protect against stretching and tear out of the leather and helps protect the laces against friction wear, as they are tightened and loosened over time.  Now having that detail, at this price point, has raised both of my eyebrows.Double hmm.  Now I am really impressed.The only thing that I didn 2019t like was that the stitching 2014that joins the uppers to the sole 2014is white.  I needed to polish these shoes anyway, so I figured I 2019d see what would happen if I put black polish on the stitching.I 2019m happy to say that the uppers shine up very nicely, to a high gloss.  This was done with just a little bit of buffing, using a traditional horse hair bristled brush.  And followed by a buffing cloth.  Although I didn 2019t do it, the leather is smooth enough that I  probably could have spit shined them.And those pesky white stitches on the top side of the soles?  Well I 2019m happy to report that they are now definitely black.Turning the shoe over, I can visually see a lump where the shank is supposed to be.  That 2019s a good thing. Not all shoes have a shank.  It helps to support the arch.  That 2019s another nice detail.  I am expecting the shank to be plastic at this price point.  So I am utterly shocked to report to you that a magnet sticks to the bottom of the shoe.  That shank is steel!  Now I am amazed!  We 2019re talking mind blown, Purple smoke everywhere.Speaking of details, I was very surprised to see the nicely done wing tip detailing, from on top of the shoe, carried over to the bottom of the sole.  Wow.  I have never seen that before.  That 2019s surprising.Now it is important to point out that the sole is some man made material.  Definitely not leather. But that 2019s okay.  Especially in the wet, leather wears out quickly, if you don 2019t wear rubber over shoes.  One less thing to fuss about.The heel itself has a band/layer of rust brown material sandwiched between black layers.  I wonder if that is a cork or bamboo material?  Having walked in these shoes, on concrete and tile floors, last week, there is a noticeable level of cush, or give. They will definitely not to be confused with sneakers.  But for dress shoes, this is a pleasant and surprising experience.The first day, I wore them at home, over the weekend and I 2019m glad I did that.  They needed time to adjust to my feet.  Any dress shoe that I have ever worn needs that.But after that, these shoes have been pleasant enough to walk around in at work.I 2019d have to say that these shoes give me at least 90% of what I would expect from my $300+ shoes for around 10% of the cost.In my estimation, at their current price point, they constitute an excellent deal.And especially if you are just breaking into the business world and need a good pair of interview shoes, these are definitely respectable 2026 just be sure to put black polish on the white stitches.Oh, BTW, I have wider feet and I ordered the shoe wide.  After the initial stretching, they fit nicely.So, in the final analysis, what do I think?  I have to say, yes, these shoes definitely get my recommendation.  Especially if price is a huge factor, then these shoes constitute  an excellent deal.",Fantastic Shoe for the Price,2023-03-20,5.0,RAMJU9M6BAIG0,Mark G.,0.0,I really like the shoes but the size are definitely too big not a normal size.

They perfectly blend the comfort of sneakers with the sleekness of dress shoes, making them an excellent choice for both casual and formal occasions.First and foremost, the design of these dress sneakers is top-notch. The oxford-style detailing and the combination of materials give them a sophisticated look, elevating my outfits effortlessly. Whether I pair them with jeans, chinos, or dress pants, they always add a touch of style and polish to my overall look.The comfort of these shoes is a pleasant surprise. The cushioned insole and padded collar provide a cozy fit, and I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. It's like walking on clouds, which is a rare find in dress shoes.I also appreciate the quality of the construction. The stitching and craftsmanship are excellent, ensuring that these sneakers hold up well even after regular use. The durable materials give me confidence that they will remain in excellent condition for a long time.The versatility of these dress sneakers is another major plus. I can easily transition from a formal event to a casual outing without having to change my shoes. This saves me time and makes them a practical choice for my busy lifestyle.Additionally, the traction on the outsole is impressive. I feel secure and steady on various surfaces, which is essential for day-to-day activities.The sizing was true to my usual shoe size, and the fit was spot on. The lace-up closure allows for an adjustable fit, ensuring that my feet stay snug and secure.In conclusion, the Bruno Marc Men's Dress Sneakers have become my go-to shoes for any occasion.

These proudly proclaim China on the box and it 2019s what I expected.  I wear dress shoes almost every day for work and I walk and do steps at lunch.  I wanted a comfortable shoe that could do it all.  I was recommended Cole Haan by a colleague.  I didn 2019t want to pay that much though so I gave these a try.  First impression is that they look kind of cheap.  I had to remove the shoelaces as they were not put in correctly and redo that.  Not a big deal.  Comfort wise they feel good at first.  The soles are extremely soft, but almost too soft.  It 2019s a weird feeling walking in them because my heels have a tendency to wear the inside portion of the heel over time.  I can feel it is exaggerated in these because the soles are so soft and I am not sure if that support would be good for me long term.  The  201cleather 201d looks cheap and a coworker actually said they look like plastic.  It 2019s not soft supple leather and it 2019s got a pleather appearance to them.  Almost a faky orange brown.  I also had a flashback to an old episode of Sponge Bob I watched years ago with my children when I wear them.  They squeak because of the materials rubbing together.  I still don 2019t know if I will keep them.  This is day one.  I also don 2019t know how long I should expect these to last.  The stitching looks pretty decent.Day 2 - the back of my heel hurts after doing steps.  the actual shoe part outside of the sole is not comfortable at all.  Still squeaking like crazy.

I've exclusively worn Saucony running shoes since about the first year, so I have plenty of experience with their shoes. They make a wide range of running shoes with a wide price range to match. They aren't as well-known as Nike or Adidas, but they really live up to their slogan of being ""true to the sport"".I normally buy their mid-price runners. At ~25 miles per week, they last about 5 - 6 months and give good support on pavement, side roads or treadmills. I happened to spot these on sale this time and was excited to get a great deal on what looked to be a newer version of their Cohesion shoes.Long story short, these are definitely not Saucony's best shoes. They feel too light, like cheap shoes you'd find at Wal Mart. They also don't have the support I normally find with Saucony. They feel more spongey - like they won't stand up to distance-running.Only time will tell. I'm going to use them on my treadmill for now, but I definitely won't buy these again.

While they do have some positive aspects, particularly in terms of comfort, there are certain areas where the quality and overall appearance fall short of my expectations.Starting with the positive, the barefoot style of these sneakers is something to appreciate. The minimalist design aims to mimic the feel of being barefoot, which is great for those who value natural movement and foot health. The wide fit is also a notable feature, providing ample room for toes to splay and ensuring a more comfortable experience.However, my reservations come in when evaluating the overall quality and appearance of the sneakers. The materials used, while functional, don't feel as premium as I had hoped. This affects both the durability and the overall aesthetics of the shoes. The build quality leaves a bit to be desired, and the appearance doesn't align with my personal taste.Furthermore, the design choices in terms of style and aesthetics aren't really in line with what I find visually appealing. This, of course, is subjective and may vary from person to person, but it's worth noting that the look of the sneakers didn't resonate with me.In terms of fit and comfort, these sneakers do offer a decent experience. The wide fit and the focus on mimicking a barefoot sensation contribute to a comfortable wear, especially for those who prioritize foot flexibility and natural movement.In conclusion, the WHITIN Men's Wide Minimalist Barefoot Sneakers provide a unique concept for those interested in a barefoot-style footwear experience. However, the overall quality and look weren't quite to my taste. While the comfort and fit aspects are commendable, the build quality and design didn't quite meet my expectations.

They are both extra comfortable and are off, and back on, in seconds. They do describe them as slip-ons but you can see they are not a house slipper for those who are complaining. To put the shoe on (like after airport security for example) you just put your foot in (while standing if you want) and use a finger or two to pull the heel on - takes 1 second, and off you go on your merry way. No sitting and wasting time tying laces.Mostly though, they are really extra comfortable. I'm buying a second pair because I know that they will probably change the design soon or discontinue the shoe or something stupid like that, and that will be just when they wear out and I want another pair!In fact, I like them so much that I ditched my expensive running shoes that I was using for travel in favor of these.",Absolutely comfortable!,2023-08-25,5.0,R2B8IPGWZD2HVR,DC Penn,0.0,I have owned several pairs of different Skechers shoes and boots.

They are wide enough to have some wiggle room for the toes and breathable. Not as breathable as ASICS excite (2nd runner up) but still great. Finally found my go to shoe!

Also, I'm not sure these are actually non-slip because I still slide around a lot since I started wearing them to work. I haven't fallen or gotten hurt, though, so the sliding isn't too much of a problem for me, but I think this issue is definitely worth mentioning for someone who might work in more dangerous conditions than I do.

However, after wearing them for a few weeks, I'm deeply disappointed with the overall quality and durability of these shoes.The first thing that struck me was the cheap material used in the construction of these shoes. The mesh upper, while touted as breathable, feels flimsy and thin. It gives off an impression that it won't withstand regular wear and tear, let alone provide any real protection against water. Within just a few wears, I noticed signs of fraying along the edges, which raises serious doubts about the long-term durability of these shoes.Moreover, the comfort level of the Avia Anchor SR shoes is not up to par. The insoles lack proper cushioning, making them uncomfortable for extended periods of wear. This is particularly disappointing considering the product's marketing emphasizes comfort. The slip-on design is convenient, but the lack of proper arch support and cushioning severely impact the overall comfort experience.In terms of water resistance, these shoes fall short of their claims. While they might handle light splashes or spills, they are far from being genuinely water-resistant. I found myself with damp feet after encountering slightly wet surfaces, which is a major drawback for a shoe advertised as water-resistant.What adds to the frustration is that the non-slip feature, one of the key selling points, doesn't live up to expectations either. The outsole's traction is mediocre at best, and I experienced instances where I still felt uneasy walking on wet or slippery floors.Considering the price point of these shoes, I had hoped for better quality. Unfortunately, the Avia Anchor SR Mesh Slip On Black Non Slip Shoes for Women simply do not deliver on their promises. The lack of attention to material quality, combined with the subpar comfort and performance, make these shoes a regrettable purchase. I would advise potential buyers to explore other options that offer better durability, comfort, and value for their money.",Won't last,2023-08-25,2.0

I've had no problems with them, they fit great and I haven't seen any quality issues, no seams coming apart. If they made a version of these with a stiffer rock plate insert in them they'd be my perfect trail running shoe. Unfortunately the trails I run on are so rocky, that I am looking for another shoe with more protection. I am very careful how I run and where I step and I don't injure my heels as I land flat footed or on my toes. But some parts of the trails I run on there is nowhere to go to avoid golf ball sized rocks and I tend to hurt the balls of my feet as the rocks really poke through. You can definitely feel the trail and have great control, I have no worries about ankle sprains which has plagued me in the past before I went with minimal shoes. But the shoes are so flexible the impact of the rocks are starting to tear up the bottom of the insert and the minor injuries are keeping me from running as much as I'd like. If you run on more reasonable trails I highly recommend these shoes.","Has held up well, fit great, feel the trail",2023-09-26,5.0,R1RW6F154YNQ1F,Alder Stone,21.0,"I should make clear that my mediocre rating (3 stars) has nothing to do with the quality of the shoes materials and workmanship, and probably not for the design.  Based on prior reviews, many people clearly like these.  But they didn't work for me.This was my first experience with this kind of shoe.  In my 72 years, I've worn dress shoes, athletic shoes, sandals (Chacos are my top), and boots of all kind.  But never anything like this.  But I wanted something light weight for workouts with my flow ropes, so thought I'd try these out.UPS delivered mine about 11 am this morning. I wore them around my apartment for a few hours on hardwood floors, a bit of carpet, and a rubber kitchen mat.  By 3 pm, I'd decided to return them.  There are multiple reasons why, in no particular order.1) They are a PITA to put on.  Since there is no tongue, they don't open wide like shoes with a real tongue.  Worse, the loop on the back above the heel is so small that getting my index finger into it was difficult -- and I have small hands for man (I wear size small gloves).  If both ends of the loop were sewn on the outside, it would work.  But one end is outside, the other end inside, so it straddles the edge.2) I've been wearing size 9 everything for decades.  So I purchased size 9 (42) because they are reportedly true to size.  But these were at least an inch too long for me.  I guess I could have lived with it, but ...3) I laced them up very loosely -- actually time with the laces completely untied -- yet they felt very tight across the top of my foot (the ""bridge"" just forward from my ankle).  And that's even with my narrow feet (I'm a 9A.)  When sitting or lying in my hammock, I felt that my foot was going to go to sleep -- that tingling sensation.  I was wearing a lightweight sock -- lightest I had, so that contributed.  I know that most people wear these without socks, but I hate that, and these were not comfortable on my bare skin at all.  I suppose I could have ordered some thin, dress socks, but I really never wear that kind.4) This last factor is what made me decide to return them.  The top of the opening -- a lightly padded ""ridge"" -- rubs against my ankle on the outside of my foot -- the ankle ""bump"".  It was starting to chafe after only moderate movement (dance movements to simulate exercise).So, again, I'm not knocking the design -- lots of people like them -- nor the quality of materials or workmanship.  But they didn't work for me.  I'm going to order a new pair of Chacos and call it good.","Good quality shoes, but they didn't work for me",2023-02-24,3.0

My primary concern is that I ordered a size 8W (wide) and while the box was marked 8W, the shoes were not. They also did not fit like a wide. The marked European/UK sizing on the box doesn 2019t indicate width either way, and a 39 can be equivalent to a US 8 or 8.5, so it 2019s hard to say what happened here. Either way, I was excited to find a cute heel with an ankle strap, chunky heel, and in a wide size. I don 2019t think it actually is wide, though.I would have gambled on going up a half size and maybe I will if I can 2019t find a similar option elsewhere, but the length fit about right and I worry there would be more of a gap at the heel if I size up. Also, for the price, the material isn 2019t fantastic. I don 2019t need to wear heels often so I wasn 2019t too worried, but the nude color at least is a very soft material that seems like it would dent/crease/bend easily. This especially seems true because the strap had a very obvious crease where it was sitting originally, I needed to tighten it by one hole and it made the strap stick out in an odd way and look bent. I don 2019t think this would hold up well to even occasional wear.The sole is nothing special for a relatively inexpensive heel, not amazingly comfortable but wearable. Additionally, while I love a block heel, these were very loud for the short stint I took in them in my kitchen and living room, on tile and hardwood respectively. VERY loud, not like any heel I 2019ve worn. It sounds very heavy and clunky, not like a tapping sound. If you work in a quiet office or are attending a quiet event, I would feel self-conscious in these.The good: these were packaged extremely well and arrived in immaculate condition. I still think the style is nice, and they had the right amount of give even in too small a size. I think they would break in a bit around the toes and form to your feet. The block heel and ankle strap do not make the shoe look any less refined. Again, the style ticked all the boxes for me on a stylish and comfortable heel. While the material itself leaned cheap-looking, I think I do like the color. A little pink for my preference on nude, but not bad. If the size had been right I probably could have forgiven the other shortcomings, and vice versa. But overall I think you can do slightly better for $60 if you shop around.",Wide size not accurate,2023-07-30,3.0

I can't remember where I saw this, but someone said that wearing barefoot shoes is like ""ASMR for your feet"", and honestly I really agree with that! It has been fun to walk in different textures in these shoes. This is also my first time wearing a shoe with a wide toe box, which has made a huge difference in my general foot pain. I have worn them just about every day for short walks or errands so that I can get used to them before making them my primary shoe for an all-day occasion.The build quality of these shoes feel pretty average, which isn't a bad thing. It doesn't feel like a shoe made with premium materials, which was what I wanted since I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that I may not like.Overall, I bought these shoes to dip my toe (pun intended) into the world of barefoot shoes and I feel that they have done their job well so far.  Personally, I will probably be looking at higher quality replacements once these start to wear down. However, I would definitely recommend these to others who are unsure about barefoot shoes but want to give it a shot without breaking the bank.Final tips: Do your research on barefoot shoes, and make sure to measure your foot for the sizing guide!",Good start for a journey in barefoot shoes,2023-09-07,4.0,R2P7GATGRE2NPZ,Julie,9.0,"For the first 6months: Office work, wearing them only about 3 days a week and only at work. Did not wear them outside or at home. So really light casual use is where the damage occurred.  So they wear out fast.Not a con because it was expected:-the flat sole, limited cushion takes a while to get used to, but I hear it 2019s better for you. And I think it has strengthened my feet and back is hurting less.  Now that they are worn, I just started using them outside.  Learning curve when walking on rocks. If you heel step, it will hurt.Pro:I have wide feet and I am loving the extra room. I would like some more, but these don 2019t hurt my feet like vans.  I have noticed a gap starting to form between my toes, meaning my feet are getting used to the room! Yay.Cons:-2month: They were BLACK but color faded after about a month.-4month: glue is starting to give but hasn 2019t gotten worst than the pic.-5month: canvas tearing inside and there is some plastic piece that broke in to little pieces that make it feel like rocks in my shoe when they come out.Overall: I applaud WHITTIN for providing a wide toe shoe against the norm. I 2019m sold on the wide toe and that alone gave me a positive experience.But, I will try other brands on my next purchase in hopes of better quality material and a longer lasting shoe for my money.

Most of these shoes have a little tread around the edges and the cleat sits in a little depression. That means that if you miss clipping in, you can still push the pedals anyway a least until you get across the intersection and can take the time to clip in properly. Not so with these shoes. With these shoes, there is no tread and the cleat sits way proud of the sole, and the sole itself is as hard and smooth as a billiard ball, so if you miss clipping in starting out from a stop, you're in big trouble. If you try to push the pedal anyway just so you can get moving, your foot will fly right off the pedal, and you may fall down because you can't get any forward momentum.My SPD pedals are one-sided. If they were two-sided it might be a little better, but it's still very dicey. And actually getting clipped in isn't as easy as it is with normal SPD shoes or even with regular SPD-SL road shoes, because since the cleat is so high up off the sole, there's no way to really feel if you have the tiny little cleat in the right place until you press down. If it clicks, you're in, if it doesn't, then you're moving slowly down the road with almost no way to pedal and keep upright. You can learn to anticipate this problem and compensate with the other foot (assuming you keep it clipped in), but not always, and it looks and feels awkward.Another dumb thing about these shoes in SPD configuration is, you can't really walk in them. Road cyclists who use SPD shoes instead of Look or SPD-SL shoes do so because they want to be able to walk around a little if needed. Well guess what; with SPD cleats on these shoes, you get all of the drawbacks of SPD-SL and none of the benefits. I got a flat on my first day out with these shoes, and I had to hike a little bit to get away from the busy road to a place where I could deal with the flat. That meant climbing up a dirt embankment carrying my bike... and I almost didn't make it. This is why I use SPD shoes with my road bike... I don't want to walk around like a crippled penguin, and I'm willing to give up the aero and power transfer benefits of SPD-SL in order to be able to walk normally. With these shoes, welcome to the worst of both worlds.The shoes themselves are too big. Most bike shoes on me are too tight in the width, but these go the other way. They look like a pair of squished foot long submarine sandwiches on my feet. But they are comfortable, and the sole is as stiff as any of my other shoes. Also, the vent in the sole does push some nice cool air onto the toes from time to time.Finally, there is the float. I thought I liked float, but these babies are like my feet and ankles are on swivels. I don't know exactly how much float I'm getting in degrees, but it's a hell of a lot more than it should be. I could be the cleats that were supplied with the shoes, or it could be due to the cleat sitting on the outside of the shoe with nothing to limit the amount your ankle can twist. There's no notch/depression for the cleat, no tread, nothing to keep your ankles more or less straight, except the cleat itself, and the cleat itself isn't working very hard.I really regret buying these. I absolutely hate them. Please, if you're looking for shoes to use on the road or trail with SPD cleats, look elsewhere. These are just awful for that use case.",Beware: Dangerous and Bad if Used with SPD Cleats on Road,2019-10-30,2.0

I had thin white crew socks on and could fit two fingers inserting in shoe behind my heel. That tells me I should of ordered a 7 & 1/2 wide. The width is perfect for my toes, they have wiggle room and big toe nor pinky toe rub against sides.  Instead of returning these and ordering a 7 & 1/2  wide I am just going to wear thicker socks. I am afraid if I go with 1/2 size smaller then my heel will rub on back of shoe and toes will hit top of shoe.As for comfort just wearing them around indoors, my feet did not hurt however I have not worn them outside on asphalt yet because of it being a rainy day. Also I have Plantar Fushia so needed a walking shoe that had good arch support and so far I believe these shoes do. I bought these to specifically do walking in because I want to get back in shape and drop some extra weight. The true test is when I actually can get my walking in to see if they still provide comfort and keep my feet from hurting. The only negative is I feel the shoes are a over priced for wide width. I could see maybe $5.00 or $10.00 extra but $15.00 extra is ridiculous. I also feel real leather should have been used for trimming especially for the price of these walking shoes.

I got these shoes last May and wore them for almost every shift since then. Here's a review after 10 months of wearing these on concrete floors.Pros: these are non-slip. I am a clumsy person and I can tell you with confidence that I never slipped once while wearing these shoes, no matter how much water, milk or soap was on the floor.These shoes look nice, the all-over black look is very professional. If they get dirty, I just wiped them down with a cleaning wipe and they looked fine again.These shoes are water resistant, maybe even water proof. I have spilled so much hot coffee on them and my toes have remained dry and unburned.These shoes have no laces than need to be tied, so they cannot become untied and you won't trip on the laces.Cons: there is almost no support in these shoes. The sole is hard as a rock and your feet will hurt after working a full shift.Like all clothes, these loosen up over time. They are slip on shoes, so they're not really meant to be tight anyway, but there is noticeable gaping around my ankle now, my foot moves a lot in my shoe.The combination of a hard, flat sole and a loose fit is now causing me problems. My foot pain after work is now lasting several days, if I happen to have time off. I tried using an insole to add some cushion, but with such a loose shoe, the added bulk just made my foot slide off the insert, leading to a new kind of soreness after my shift.I've developed cuboid syndrome and require manual manipulation and wrapping to manage my pain. This may have been avoided if I replaced my shoes earlier, but I've always had a hard time with that. If there are no actual holes, I will keep wearing a pair of shoes.Would I buy these shoes again? Probably not these exact ones, but another pair from Sketchers, a pair with laces I can tighten as the shoe gets more worn. My advice is to skip these exact shoes, but stick with this brand. They are perfectly non-slip and water-resistant in my experience, but they require more padding, some arch support and definitely the ability to tighten them down the more you wear them.","Non-slip, water-resistant.

This was not golf in the rain, the course was just wet from the night before.  Too bad... I still wear these shoes around town as they are comfortable and I like the way they look.  Other than the dryness issue, I like they way they perform on the course too.  Oh well... you get what you pay for.  -1 star from original of 4 stars.ORINGINAL REVIEW: I was going to wait a little while to review these shoes because of the previous questionable reviews.  However, yesterday sealed the deal for me!  Granted I only have about 10 rounds of golf on these so longevity is YTBD, but yesterday I played in the rain and mud with these shoes after a day when my area received 3.5"" of rain the day before.  The course was Muddy and WET and I was concerned that these shoes, being less expensive then some of the best reviewed, might not hold up.  Not only were my socks and feet bone dry at the end of the round but my feet felt great!  They shed water like a champ and even though they are spikeless, I felt no slippage on any shot (tee box or fairway).  From other reviews, it looks like there is a tendency for the laces to rip through the leather eyelets. I have been weary of that so the first few rounds I was ""careful"" not to pull too hard but the last few rounds I've been testing them a little more for durability.  So far, no problem.  Anyway, I try to leave reviews that help other consumers so here are the pros and cons readers digest version.  This is one mans opinion, YMMV.The golfer leaving the review:*Male - 6'2"" - 185lbs - size 12 medium*Mid 50's*Golf 3-5 times a week (12 Handicap)* Has owned numerous golf shoes from FootJoy and other well known brands.Pros*Comfortable (like, super-wear-all-day-type-comfortable)*Good looking if you like the sneaker vibe*so far, appear to do well in wet weather (UPDATE: 2 months in they are leaking!)*nice and cool on hot days*flexible upper mesh (see cons for same feature)*spikeless sole has provided good stability*fits this golfer's narrow foot but feels like it could be comfortable for wider fits.Cons*Still concerned about eyelets ripping (will report here if so)*May not provide great side to side stability for some golfers (Mesh upper not the same as shoes with leather upper)*Spikeless sole not an aggressive tread - aggressive golfers with faster swing speeds than I, may have issues.For $90.00 (and if the eyelets don't break) this is a great value in a golf shoe.  Took off one star only for the stability factor.",Surprising Performer - UPDATED AFTER 2 1/2 MONTHS,2021-07-11,3.0

The toe box in the Wide width is perfect for my feet, with no squeezing or pressure. For reference, the 10W measures about 3.75"" across the widest point of the ball of the foot (3.5"" sole, but the leather has some give to it). The flat notch at the back of the heel avoids putting undue pressure on the Achilles tendon. Although the footbed is contoured and would probably be fine for someone with flat feet, there isn't a lot of internal arch support for those of us with higher arches. Fortunately, the sides of the shoes are high enough to accommodate inserts (my orthotics are elevated about 1.2"" at the arch and they fit fine in these without showing above the leather upper, as you can see in the photos). The leather soles are scored but still very slick, so if you aren't using these for dance where you need low friction movement, you'll probably want to add some adhesive traction pads.Bonus: They double as attractive business casual/dress shoes, and the low heel makes them comfortable enough for all-day wear.

Honestly, my feet felt more comfortable without the inserts!The color is a brighter blue than what the Amazon pictures show but I think they're still stylish while being comfortable. The tread is solid and has a lot of grip for my use. (I don't plan to do any hiking but may use them doing some yardwork when they get old.) I bought these a 1/2 size larger as, in my older age, I'm having some ""toe issues"" and I'm glad I did! The Columbia's give my toes plenty of room without making the shoe feel too oversized.I would definitely recommend this brand and make/model.

These shoes offer a great combination of style and functionality, making them a reliable choice for outdoor enthusiasts like myself. However, they do have a couple of downsides that I think are worth mentioning.First things first, the adidas Terrex AX4 shoes have an attractive design. I find their aesthetics to be quite appealing, and they look fantastic on the trails.Speaking of the trails, these shoes have accompanied me on hiking adventures in Zion and Alaska, and they have performed admirably. I have experienced no issues with slippage or loss of grip, which is a testament to their reliable outsole.However, one area where the Terrex AX4 falls short is in terms of comfort. While they are perfectly suitable for hiking purposes, I would not recommend them for everyday use. The cushioning is not as soft as I would have liked, and after prolonged wear, I found that my feet would feel fatigued. It would have been nice to have a bit more cushioning or support in the midsole to enhance comfort during extended periods of walking or standing.That being said, for their intended purpose as hiking shoes, the adidas Terrex AX4 shoes offer durability and stability. The construction feels sturdy, and I have noticed no signs of wear and tear despite subjecting them to challenging trails and varying weather conditions.In conclusion, the adidas Terrex AX4 shoes are a solid choice for hikers seeking a reliable and stylish option. They excel in terms of traction and durability, making them well-suited for outdoor adventures in diverse landscapes. However, if you're looking for everyday shoes with a softer and more cushioned feel, you might want to consider other options. Nonetheless, these shoes have served me well during my outdoor escapades, and I would recommend them to fellow hikers seeking reliable footwear.Overall Rating: 4/5 stars.","Good and Sturdy, but...",2023-07-12,4.0,R1YGNME7Y01IC1,D & S,0.0,This is the first pair of Adidas I have owned in many years.  I really like the look and how comfortable this shoe is.  I suffer from time to time with severe foot pain and these shoes do not seem to aggravate my feet at all.  I wear these shoes indoors 10 plus hours a day about 3 times a week.  I went with a hiking type tennis shoe in hopes the durability would be at a higher level.  Unfortunately in less than 2 months one of the shoes has a small dime size hole on the inside heel area of the shoe and the other shoe appears to be headed in the same direction.  I understand that this can happen over time but to happen so soon is extremely disappointing.,Durability in question,2023-07-30,3.0

The BOA system is very smooth and works well to lock in in seconds (and adjust throughout the round which I love and something I cannot/do not do with laces).CONS:  The Puma Ignites continue to run about a half size too long - not the biggest deal, but annoying.  This has been an issue for years with Puma's golf line that they are not addressing for some odd reason.  The biggest issue for me was the traction!  It is terrible.  The rubber compound they use on the outsole is soft and wearing quickly, and the nubs/spikes are not deep enough or spaced out enough in certain areas to grip the turf.  This has caused my left foot to slip during impact making me pull the shot on occasion which is NOT ok with me (RH, low single digit golfer).  They don't slip all the time, but do enough for me to deem the traction a failure for golf.  I have only played them during dry rounds too.  For comparison, I had a UA spikeless shoe before these and that traction was incredible even in wet weather.Big disappointment for me as I love the way they look and feel, but I do not want to wear them golfing any longer.","Very Comfortable, but sketchy traction!",2023-05-04,3.0

This is the third time I have bought these shoes. I use them to go to work and they work great for me because I don't like waring high heels, they are very comfortable and they look good for a work environment. I keep buying these shoes because I have never had any problems with them in terms of being too big, or too small or making my feet hurt or bleed in some place. I just want something I know will work from the moment I put my foot in them until I have to throw them out without the anxiety of having 500 band aids handy in case they hurt me. They last me about a year/ year and half of daily use for work at an office and 2 hours of walking to and from work, so I keep buying them on repeat because they work great for my purposes. The first time I bought these shoes I bought them directly from Clarks in the store after trying them on and hoping that they would work. The other two times I bought them from amazon and they seemed identical. However, this last time I bought them these shoes via amazon, the fit is a little larger than the other two previous times, even when compared to the fit at the end of their life when they had holes in the soles. Somewhat unfortunate, but I still like them and I will keep buying them over and over, although I may drop half a size next time, I don't know.

They walked at Mesa Verde, Chimney Rock, Four Corners, Monument Valley, climbed up to the North and South Windows at Arches National Park. The tread of the sole gave me sure footing as I climbed up and down the rocks.I almost didn 2019t buy them because I could only return them if unworn. To know if a shoe will work and not hurt my feet, I need to wear them in my everyday activities, not just a couple of steps on my living room floor. I was desperate, so I took the chance and started wearing them. They are so comfortable and fit my foot well. I am so glad I did!I really was nervous because of the anatomy of my feet. It is difficult to fit me because:1) I have a fan-shaped foot (narrow heel and D-width ball of my foot)2) Bunions3) Straight Achilles tendon4) Morton 2019s toe (2nd toe is longer than big toe)What I like:On this shoe, the toe box is long enough  for my toes. The wide width gives me enough space to wear socks and my joints don 2019t stick out beyond the sole of the shoe. The foot-shape toe box allows my toes to relax and spread out. I love Ked 2019s tennis shoes, but they have an almond shaped toe box and my big and little toes were being pushed under the other toes, causing joint pain and inflammation. The shoe sits flat without any toe curl, which gives me more stability. There is only a small, thin Achilles tendon pad. Achilles tendon support and padding in shoes cause my feet to go numb with nerve pain shooting up my calves. This also is a zero drop shoe which allows for a straighter posture and stability as I am not being tipped forward. What I like most is that my feet do not hurt at the end of the day. (Even with all the walking and climbing I 2019ve done this week!)While I do not need it, I believe that I could put an extra insole or arch support in them and still have enough room.I am very pleased and happy with these shoes. I will purchase these again. I do wish there were more colors available in wide width, especially red and navy. Do I recommend them? Yes, definitely!","Finally, A Foot Shaped Shoe I Can Wear!",2023-07-20,5.0,R3VRO1FFI3ZNLO,Melissa Rappleye,0.0,"I really liked the idea of these shoes, but there were two things that made me return them. First. They were a little snug, if you're in between sizes make sure to go up. I did 10 1/2 and needed a solid 11. Second, the shoe has a canvas like material which makes the shoe look cheap and wrinkly. It's not smooth like the picture. I felt like the shoes looked a little peasant like. I might try a different style or at least try different brand for wide toes, but these ones I didn't like them enough to want to spend $40","Love the idea, but still a fail",2023-08-22,3.0

This is my first time ever using an indoor cycle, so I 2019m very new to everything.I was having really bad foot pain while trying to cycle and was constantly having to take breaks to let my feet calm down. I did some research and found that the most likely cause was shoes that were too small.I have fat feet (both in width and height) and could barely get the peloton shoes on, but I tried to make it work since the pedals do require the specialized shoes. I even tried to bootleg it and use regular Nobull running shoes that feel fine during any other activity but my feet still hurt during cycling.So, I set out on my search to find wide width cycling shoes. Let me tell you, wasn 2019t an easy search. I guess fat people aren 2019t common in the cycling world  d83d de02I came across these and hoped they would work since the top is all Velcro. I used them for the first time and they do indeed work. Obviously, they don 2019t Velcro all the way across but they do go over about half way and stayed velcroed for my full 30-min ride. The tongue of the shoe is not attached at the sides, so that helps as well. I still had a toe or two that went numb towards the end of my ride, but it was nothing at all like the pain I had before so I 2019m going to chalk that up to my feet getting used to pushing against resistance for a long period of time without being able to shift the position of my feet due to them being clipped in lol. Only negative to them actually being roomy enough for my fat feet was I couldn 2019t clip out bc my feet slipped out of the shoes before I could apply enough pressure to clip out lol.I will likely order another pair of these and am just so relieved to have found shoes that work for my chunky feet  d83d de4c d83c dffb",Works for fat feet,2023-08-24,5.0,R1QRLLVPERBOPX,JRS,0.0,"Ordered in two sizes.

I walked a few miles on a flat trail to break them in, but it wasn't really necessary.

The chunky, 90s inspired lug sole seemed cute and practical, like it would be good for Fall/Winter.But- and why I sadly had to return them- they lack good padding in the ball of the foot and run too small and narrow in the largest available size (11). Can't add any type of insoles or cushions because there isn't any room. I bought these in part because the description mentioned extra support and cushioning but, honestly, I didn't notice much difference between these and any other standard, non-comfort type shoe. After less than 5 minutes my feet started to hurt from being pinched in the too-narrow toe box. Walking just a few paces on a thick carpet left my feet and calves sore from too little cushioning. Since these aren't leather, there's no chance they'll stretch out with wear to become more comfortable. Life's too short for painful shoes, so, sadly back these go.Would really like to see more fun, trendy styles like this in larger sizes (manufacturers generally seem to still think people with larger feet are all about 150 years old & have no interest in anything pretty, fun or stylish!) Not sure if a size 12 might've been more comfortable and/or worked better for me with an insole but at least having that as an option would've been nice.For the record, I'm about 5'10, medium build and usually wear a standard width size 11 in most shoes without needing to size up to a wide width or a 12. Thankfully, no foot health issues.These might be good for someone with a more narrow foot and/or someone who isn't looking for much in the way of cushioning and support in their footwear.",Looks great but runs narrow & lacks cushioning,2023-08-17,3.0

I traditionally wear mizunos, but my last couple of pairs seemed to not last me as long and for the price I pay for them I thought it was time to try something new. I read several articles on top volleyball shoes and the crazy flights were listed several times.Upon receiving them I put in my custom insoles and played in them for the first time.They were extremely uncomfortable in the ankle area to the point where I ended up with bruises right under the ball of my ankle on both feet. I readjusted my lacing the next time around and wore calf height socks. That gave a little more cushion, but they were still uncomfortable.Finally, I put bandaids over where the bruises appeared and wore high socks and did NOT lace the shoes through the top eyes on the shoe and it became bearable to wear.I love the color and look of the shoe. I 2019ve had no slipping at all, but if the ankle pain doesn 2019t stop after I wear them in a little more then this will be a waste of money.Very disappointed if these end up not working. I will likely go back to the mizuno wave lightenings then.UPDATE: The shoes ended up wearing in after about two weeks of wearing them and the ankle rubbing and bruising subsided. Overall these are decent shoes. I 2019ve had them for a handful on months now and these are my final thoughts:Pros: No slipping at all. Grip on the court is solid.Cons: The above mentioned initial ankle pain from wearing in, they seem to need retying more regularly than other brands, the toes get scuffed instantly so light colors will have skid marks on the toe box exterior, and finally these shoes hold moisture, so if you play daily or keep your shoes in a gym bag expect them to take a few days to dry out.","Cute design, but uncomfortable on ankles",2022-09-28,3.0

Right  out of the box it's a beautiful shoe. They are very light which is something I was looking for but once I slipped them on,  2079there was no cushion and not enough arch support for me. I have heel pain without the right support as I work an oncology unit and always on my feet then we add 7 days of workouts, these won't cut it. So I added my orthotics which felt great and fit perfect! The heels felt a little loose but I tightened the laces and started my training. With standing exercises like star tilts they were amazing as I could feel my shoe helping with stability. Then when I did lunge jumps, I had to take them off and replace them with the trainers I was using previously because the Rykas kept wanting to come off. They don't grip the heel as they should which could cause injury with all the movement I do during workouts. If your questioning if I got the right size. The answer is yes, otherwise the shoe would be too short. I wear a 5.5. I do a lot of jumps and lunges so this will not be a training shoe. If you need a shoe for weight lifting where your just need stability this may work for you. They are comfortable enough once I added the orthotics so tonight I am going to see how they hold up to a 12 hour shift so atleast I can get my money's worth out of them some how.Update: I worked a 12 hour shift with Dr Scholls inserts and my feet didn't hurt so.. I can bump this up to 3 stars only because I have to use the inserts and I cannot wear them to cross train in them as they suggest.

This is my first time ever using an indoor cycle, so I 2019m very new to everything.I was having really bad foot pain while trying to cycle and was constantly having to take breaks to let my feet calm down. I did some research and found that the most likely cause was shoes that were too small.I have fat feet (both in width and height) and could barely get the peloton shoes on, but I tried to make it work since the pedals do require the specialized shoes. I even tried to bootleg it and use regular Nobull running shoes that feel fine during any other activity but my feet still hurt during cycling.So, I set out on my search to find wide width cycling shoes. Let me tell you, wasn 2019t an easy search. I guess fat people aren 2019t common in the cycling world  d83d de02I came across these and hoped they would work since the top is all Velcro. I used them for the first time and they do indeed work. Obviously, they don 2019t Velcro all the way across but they do go over about half way and stayed velcroed for my full 30-min ride. The tongue of the shoe is not attached at the sides, so that helps as well. I still had a toe or two that went numb towards the end of my ride, but it was nothing at all like the pain I had before so I 2019m going to chalk that up to my feet getting used to pushing against resistance for a long period of time without being able to shift the position of my feet due to them being clipped in lol. Only negative to them actually being roomy enough for my fat feet was I couldn 2019t clip out bc my feet slipped out of the shoes before I could apply enough pressure to clip out lol.I will likely order another pair of these and am just so relieved to have found shoes that work for my chunky feet  d83d de4c d83c dffb",Works for fat feet,2023-08-24,5.0,R1QRLLVPERBOPX,JRS,0.0,"Ordered in two sizes.

Perhaps if you're a runner, hiker, or someone who walks normally, you'll be okay, but I literally dance as I walk, and I do A LOT of turns and pivots on my toes. After a month, a significant hole developed on the side of the big toe of my left shoe. So, I had to throw these sneaks away. I get better wear from my $40 Asics running shoes. I'm also disappointed in the colors this company offers. Most have white soles, which I do not like because they get dirty very easily. I chose the slate gray with the aqua soles. That's the best they had. I think the company can do better.  All in all, it was a wasted $100 something dollars for me. I might try ALTRA Women's AL0A5484 Paradigm 6 Road Running Shoe in the color navy.

The fit of size L was perfect for my size 11 business shoes, which include wholecuts, Oxfords, double monk straps etc. I also own some of the higher-end brand shoe trees, and frankly do not see any difference in amount or quality of wood. The metal parts have the same thickness and springiness. Since one reviewer mentioned that they received 12 pieces for the left foot, which also were labeled 'L': yes, mine were also all labeled 'L'(arge), and there was no indication for left/right foot, but the shape clearly indicates what was right versus left. So, I received 6 pairs of size 'L', and I hope that this comment helps others in their decision to purchase this very good quality and very well priced 6-pack.Sidenote:These stretchers make a huge difference: they keep good leather dress shoes in shape (in particular those with leather soles), and the non-treated wood eliminates odors and traps moisture after wearing. Creases will form less quickly and the leather soles won't start bending upwards in the toe area.For these reasons, one should never wear the same pair of leather shoes the next day again. Trapped moisture and sweat will make the leather bulge and stretch out excessively, and the shoes will look worn out very quickly.","Good wood, identical to more pricey products",2023-08-18,5.0,R2AVL4WDQVQQVD,Amazon Customer,1.0,"I bought 6 ""pairs"" of shoe trees.

I love the way the color deepens toward the seams and lightens up as you reach the open areas. They really are a very beautiful pair of shoes and look a lot more expensive than what I paid.Cons: They are very narrow. I have very wide feet and finding off the rack shoes to fit them is always a problem. Usually I can just order one size too large and after a few days of stretching they will conform. These shoes have done that to a great extent -they were physically painful to put on day one. After about 2 hours of wear on day 1, they slid right on day two. After two more hours on day two, I wore them for a week at work. The right shoe now feels just fine, but the left one never quite gave into the full width of my foot.I knew the con going in which is why I am still giving them four starts.  My feet are quite wide and very few off the rack shoes can accommodate them -even some shoes labeled wide are too narrow. These shoes did pretty admirably and I will continue to wear them. They just can't be an every day shoe unless and until that left one conforms like the right one did. Still, beautiful shoes.",Verry nice.

My background:  I am 75 years old and walk my dog two times a day.  The path is in the wooded area in the back of my house.  It is a 1/4-mile trail up and down through some pretty good bumps and valleys.  I had Foxelli Men 2019s Hiking Boots for 2 1/2 years and they were giving out and water coming in.  You may ask the wisdom of buying boots just to walk the dog.  My dog is not the best trained dog that has come down the pike.  He is a Newfoundland-Lab mix and weighs 120 pounds.  When I use to walk him with street shoes, I took a tumble twice.  Once when there was mud and the next time trying to help my dog catch a deer.  I know what a face plant and dragging through the woods feels like.  The Foxelli boots were good and got me a few years.  It did give me a blister at first, but it went away and never had problems.  The new Merrell Men's Moab 3 Mid Waterproof Hiking Boot is great so far.  It seems to have a tighter grip than the last shoes.  It is very comfortable, and it is waterproof.  I always see post that say they will update later and never do.  If I think about it, I will but remember the age of the person typing this review.  Great hiking boot, looks good, and I would definitely buy it again.",It is a good hiking shoe,2023-09-20,5.0,RRU2JITY9VFZQ,slydero,23.0,"I needed new boots to replace my Timberlands which failed me after only 3 years of moderate use. Did a ton of research on the Moab's and the Targhee's. Despite some reviews about durability issues, I ordered both to check out. Got the Targhee's and they're pretty nice. Got the Moab's and was very suspect. They came in a non-branded box and the tags on the backside of the tongues showed ""Made in Bangladesh,"" and the stitching around some of the eyelets was sub-par (no, I'm not a shoe stitching expert).I remembered reading another reviewer who stated that he had gotten a second pair of Moab's... first pair he loved. Second pair fell apart in months. He said that the first pair was made in Vietnam (I could be wrong) while the second pair was made in Bangladesh. I have no idea how the shoe industry works, but it feels like the Bangladesh versions are either fakes, or just a lower end version they sell for less? I went into the Merrell outlet near me just to see what 'real' Merrell's looked like. All of the in-store shoes (Moab's or otherwise) were made in Asian countries, but none from Bangladesh.Aside from that, I did try on several pairs of Moab's while in the Merrell store. I was surprised at how not amazing they felt after reading so many positive reviews. They were decent, but they just didn't feel great for me personally. I can see how others could love them though. They're probably pretty nice once they break in.Anyway, if you're looking into getting these, just be aware that the Bangladesh versions might be sub-par or fakes. Again, I could be wrong and they might actually make some in Bangladesh, but I didn't see any tagged as such in the actual store.UPDATE: I took a photo of the Bangladesh tag before returning them. I also received a pair of Moab low's the day after this review and they came in an actual Merrell box and the tag looked like the tags I saw in store (this pair was made in Myanmar, which I did see in the store as well). I've posted a photo of that tag as well. If you compare the tags you can see pretty obvious differences, even in the fabric the tags are sewn into.As for the low version of the Moab's... I unfortunately returned those as well. They feel like you're riding high on top of the shoes, vs in them. And the soles didn't feel that great either. They'd probably feel a lot different after breaking in, but again, I've committed to giving the Keen's a go instead.",Buyer beware?,2023-01-05,3.0

If excessively soiled, soak in Oxyclean overnight and then wash.The fit is true to size but slightly snug as you break it in. The entire front of the shoe is like a soft mesh so it's very comfortable, but that also means if you kick anything it'll hurt, trust me. The cushion is pretty good- an upgrade over non running shoes but not excessive like Hoka's. I can walk for about one and a half hours before my feet actually start hurting.Overall, would recommend.

Size is a little on the small size.,0.0,R3VM02G9QV63M1,ctguy,0.0,"First off, these are pretty good looking shoes, but definitely have a unique style with the wide and flat toe area that's characteristic of them. The branding is a bit over the top too but I guess you need to do something to grab attention. I guess these are the ""bold"" line so maybe that makes sense. The blue laces definitely add impact. The laces, now that was interesting to me. My last pair of foot joys (admittedly years ago) had the waxed style laces and I remember tying them repeatedly when walking a round. These laces seem to have silicone dots along them and they really grabbed both on the shoes and on themselves once tied. Honestly I wish more laces had this simple enhancement because they really do grab and stay in position.These feel good. I went with a size 12 based on some other reviews. I normally wear an 11.5 and they seem to fit as expected...slightly larger than I would normally wear, but don't feel quite as big as a 12 usually does to me. I have not had a chance to play with these yet because of an unfortunate bout of tennis elbow so I only have experience walking with them. They are comfortable and mimicking my swing feels pretty good. I can't test out the big claims but I'm skeptical. To improve my distance by 8+ yards just based on shoes seems too good to be true. Enhancing stability, with the potential to improve distance I might agree with.I haven't tested the waterproofness but having a 2 year warranty on it is a nice touch as long as they stand behind it. I have no reason to doubt their performance.Overall they seem a bit gimmicky, but lots of golf equipment does. This design does seem to make biomechanical sense and I can feel a bit of a difference in how planted my back foot feels compared to stiffer more traditional golf shoes.  Your mileage may vary, but I think these are a pretty solid choice.",Interesting concept - not quite sure about the claims,2023-09-09,4.0,R2FWZYZH6L1PAP,BirdMan,0.0,I really wanted to like these shoes given the fact sepp straka wears them and they feel comfortable but the quality of the craftsmanship right out of the box is some of the worst I 2019ve ever seen in a golf shoe.

This is my first time ever using an indoor cycle, so I 2019m very new to everything.I was having really bad foot pain while trying to cycle and was constantly having to take breaks to let my feet calm down. I did some research and found that the most likely cause was shoes that were too small.I have fat feet (both in width and height) and could barely get the peloton shoes on, but I tried to make it work since the pedals do require the specialized shoes. I even tried to bootleg it and use regular Nobull running shoes that feel fine during any other activity but my feet still hurt during cycling.So, I set out on my search to find wide width cycling shoes. Let me tell you, wasn 2019t an easy search. I guess fat people aren 2019t common in the cycling world  d83d de02I came across these and hoped they would work since the top is all Velcro. I used them for the first time and they do indeed work. Obviously, they don 2019t Velcro all the way across but they do go over about half way and stayed velcroed for my full 30-min ride. The tongue of the shoe is not attached at the sides, so that helps as well. I still had a toe or two that went numb towards the end of my ride, but it was nothing at all like the pain I had before so I 2019m going to chalk that up to my feet getting used to pushing against resistance for a long period of time without being able to shift the position of my feet due to them being clipped in lol. Only negative to them actually being roomy enough for my fat feet was I couldn 2019t clip out bc my feet slipped out of the shoes before I could apply enough pressure to clip out lol.I will likely order another pair of these and am just so relieved to have found shoes that work for my chunky feet  d83d de4c d83c dffb",Works for fat feet,2023-08-24,5.0,R1QRLLVPERBOPX,JRS,0.0,"Ordered in two sizes.  One size came obviously used so sent those back.  The second pair fit, a little big, but decided to use.  Clips are horrible to get clipped into the Peloton and impossible to remove .

They may last longer if cared for diligently by cleaning and applying synthetic leather conditioner often.Usage: Around 5-6 times a week for relatively light usage (non-daily to office, around town, cycling). Occasional longer walks or hikes.Immediate: The sole, especially the heel, will wear away fairly quickly with any grinding or sliding. Going down a slide once left a visible dent at the end of the sole. The synthetic leather quickly develops creases, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.Around 1 month in - Finish on the sides and near the heel is starting to wear away to reveal white below the blue finish. Could have easily been avoided if the entire plastic piece was colored throughout.Around 10 months in - The leather upper of the shoes is beginning to separate from the sole, specifically near the toe box where the sole goes from slim to thick. This caused the shoes to loose their water resistance and walking through a small puddle would result in wet socks.It was at this point that I super glued the upper to the sole and retired the shoes to ""beater"" status. Felt like this shoe degraded faster than expected, but then again I knew what I was getting into for a ~$40 ""lifestyle"" shoe.Overall I don't think I would recommend these with the exceptions: Can't find a similar style, can't afford a higher quality real leather shoe, don't mind getting new shoes often, or plan on extremely light usage.","Good Looking, Comfy, but Poor Durability",2023-08-03,4.0,R3OXTZU42SD71L,Nick Stapleton,0.0,"It's pretty comfortable, but after about 6 months of casual use, the tongue doesn't stay upright anymore.

No surprise trips to the hardware store, which, let's be honest, we all dread.Now, on to the real question: Can it hold up my mountain of laundry? The answer is a resounding yes.

I failed to research the current description, which says Oxford cloth now incorporates man-made fibers including polyester and other synthetics and that Oxford is mainly a type of weave.The cloth these bags are made of is definitely a blend, at best, and may not include any cotton.  And it seems to be coated with something.I could not spare the time to return the bags, and it also seemed pointless as measurements are apparently not trustworthy and the type of fabric can be anything.After so few days of use, I don't know if they will be sturdy or durable.

It actually exceeded my expectations, especially for the fit and wear & tear you will put it through, as it is a Carhartt. Carhartt means, it was made to be USED and not just worn.  Any man will know the difference between wearing something and actually using it.I have about a Medium size to slightly medium-large sized head. Medium because of the shape and size of my head is Medium like anyone else with a medium sized head.  However, the large part is because the vertical length of my head is slightly longer.  Kind of like your shoe size may really be a size 10, however because you may have wide feet you have to get a size 11 just to accommodate the width, if a size 10W isn't available.If you're looking for a Medium sized hat with a little bit of length to it, then this would be the hat to get.Realistically, the hat is slightly a little bigger because of the length and its new.  However for a Man, it's always good to purchase a hat that is slightly bigger than what you presumably need, because you never know what your going to be stuck doing, like a lot of shoveling or out scraping cars when it's ice cold out and you need that extra part/length of the hat to cuff and cover your ears really well to keep them warm and protected.If you put this hat on all the way w/o cuffing it, and wear/pull it all the way down until there is no more to material to pull down, it will reach to about the base of the head/neck, with still a little slack left over.In terms of long term use and durability, this is also another reason why I love this hat.  As it does have slightly a little extra slack to it.  Depending on your purpose, occupation or whatever the heck you'll be doing that you'll be wearing this hat, it can be adjusted in many different positions.You'll also more than likely you'll end up putting it in the wash.  When you wash this hat, I highly recommend washing it only with other winter type articles of clothing, or maybe a small load of shirts or sweaters at most.  Yes, you could wash it with just a regular full load of laundry or anything else, but I don't recommend it if you want this hat to last a long time. Like anything else in this life, If you take care of it, it will take care of you. The best way to dry it would either be to throw it in the dryer for 5 minutes at the most and let it hang dry. However, if you want to dry it in the dryer all the way, put it on very light heat for about 10 to 15 minutes, or just let the dryer run on air dry with no heat for about 20 to 30 minutes. If you drive too much, that will get more worn Out and used then if you were wearing and using it yourself, which means it won't last long.This is my 2nd year purchasing this exact hat, as I still have the 1st hat from last year.  Except this time/year, I purchased 2 more from Amazon.The 1st hat was purchased at a retail location.  Then I found it online at Amazon for a fraction of the price.  I was hesitant at 1st, because the price on Amazon was substantially lower.  However, when I received these from Amazon, upon further examination, it was the same exact one that I purchased at retail.I purchased additonally hats because I have a habit of losing them. When you find a product or item that works well, especially a winter hat, it's a good idea to purchase a few extra ones.If you lose the only one that you have or if you've really got some really good use out of the one that you have had for a long time and you know it's more than likely it's time for you to throw it out, you know it's going to be close to impossible to find another one again that works exactly like the one that you had and grown accustom to that you know that works. We all know that all good things come to an end  it don't last forever. Then before you know it, your stuck having to go from store to store (site-to-site) to try to find a hat that fits or is comfortable, especially in the middle of winter when you just lost your hat. To top it off, you can no longer find that same exact hat. I've been through that before and it sucks.So in closing this is a very good hat, because of the good comfortable fit, durability, longevity and that It will take good care of you; and especially for the price.  You can't beat the price for the brand that you're getting which also makes it easier to buy extra hats.If you're going to buy extra hats, I recommend buying at least 2 or 3 extra or total of 3 or 4 hats. 1 hat for obvious reasons; an extra 1 at home in case you lose 1, 1 extra one for in your car under your seat in case you forget your hat or lose it while you're out and abou, that way you have an extra one in the car when you need it.  Also, 1 hat left at work.  The extra hats in the car or at work also serve a great purpose for helping somebody else out that may not have a hat that clearly needs one.",Very comfortable and warm.

I wanted some undies for my centaur, but one pair of shorts was poorly sewn and ripped while I was dressing her, they can be fixed but I'm lazy. The shorts/shirts outfits work pretty well for my teenar girls and bonnies, which is why I wanted this set anyways (I like sitting them down without seeing up their dress, and I like my dolls in less feminine clothes. The striped shirt outfits are what they'll be wearing for a bit and I think it's so cute!!)Are these well-made? No. Will they all work for BJDs? No. Are some of the outfits an eyesore? Yes.

I failed to research the current description, which says Oxford cloth now incorporates man-made fibers including polyester and other synthetics and that Oxford is mainly a type of weave.The cloth these bags are made of is definitely a blend, at best, and may not include any cotton.  And it seems to be coated with something.I could not spare the time to return the bags, and it also seemed pointless as measurements are apparently not trustworthy and the type of fabric can be anything.After so few days of use, I don't know if they will be sturdy or durable.

Slight delay.,0.0,R1UFHCKZZPII4J,"Moody, Maine",0.0,"Recently remodeled master bedroom, and original wiring plan involved much more extensive and expensive work to install 3-way switches at bedroom entrance and above each night stand, to control overhead and reading lights, as well as lamps on a credenza.These worked perfectly.  Pico remotes can be easily programmed to control individual or multiple lights/plugs at the same time.  Multiple remotes also can control the same lights/plugs such as having a set  of remotes for each side of the bed.  For the two bedside reading lights I ordered  Pico remotes with an illuminated center buttons.The dimmer also works perfectly with my Philips GU-10 LED bulbs in the ceiling's recessed fixtures -- these bulbs get warmer as you dim them.  I also recommend buying the weighted bases to hold the remotes -- in my configuration, I have three remotes on each bedside, which fit neatly together in these angled bases - they come in single, double and triple models.  These stands also protects the remotes from getting wet if you knock over a glass of water during the night, and keeps our cat from batting them off the nightstand.My only issue was that I accidentally programmed one of the remotes to turn on and off more than one lamp, and Lutron's customer forum is a bit kludgy to navigate.  Some of the suggestions didn't work for my Caseta / Pico remote combo, but another customer reported that he spoke with a live Lutron agent and these steps worked:1) On the lower off button on the Pico remote, quickly tap 4 times and hold down the button on the 5th press until the solid green light comes on.  Then again quickly tap the lower button 4 times.2) The above worked perfectly to reset the Pico remote, and I was easily able to reprogram it by holding down the off button on the wall switch until it flashes, and then holding down the off button on the Pico remote until it flashes and synchs with the switch.",Saves Electrical Wiring Costs and Labor,2023-09-07,5.0,R35JZNKKL6KGKK,Sandra Marlow,0.0,This model did not work for us.

If you 2019re like me and tend to overload things, you 2019ll wish it were made of stronger stuff in no time.Speaking of overloading, adding and removing garments is a bit of a frustrating affair. You have to thread them between the rods of your choice, which is trickier than it seems.

I'm slender and athletic (5'9"", 137 lbs) but I can't stand if something is tight on my waist.  It makes me feel nauseous.  Usually if I size up, I'm pulling my leggings up all day.  These shorts are not like that at all!  I did order a large for a more comfortable waist and I'm glad I did.  They are very flattering!  This is also my first pair of seamless and I'm never going back!  No camel toe!  I just ordered the full leggings and I'm hoping I feel just as satisfied with those!",Size up for a more comfortable waist.,2023-09-18,5.0,R2VOP5XJNP6KIY,Amazon Customer,187.0,"This review might be a little long but HEAR ME OUT!  When I tell you I sprinted to go on amazon and try these babies out, guuuuurrrrrllll I mf SPRINTED! I had to see if these were the ultimate dupes for one of my favorite gym shorts or even better. I had super high hopes for these beauties and even though they are not what I was expecting they are damn near close. So I thought I would share my thoughts because I can't stop thinking about these shorts and I WANT to be a huge fan of them! If there's an update on these shorts in the future, you best believe I'm buying ALL the colors in my size!!!So let's start with the positives. These shorts are admittedly on another level in a good way! They are comfy, soft, breathable, stretchy, squat proof (at least the color I tried on), and fits in almost all the right places for me. To give you a mental picture I would say that I have a curvy athletic build, super tall 6'1"", around 180 pounds, and hold most of my weight in the lower region of my body aka below the hips. My peach is a combination of fat and muscle but it is not like the super perky butts you see on social media. So I tend to spend some coin on shorts and leggings that flatter that part of my body for added confidence. Then I heard about these bad boys and gave them a shot. I got a size L (I'm usually between M-L) because I personally like the extra room for the gainz and I usually like sizing up in short anyways but I digress.Even though I've only tried them on, I would say they are sooooooo close to being the perfect dupe of ""that brand"" that has blown up for their amplify collection. I think these are great for a lift, yoga, walks, hikes, lounging around and probably even other forms of cardio. From my short test I did at home while trying these on (squats, high knees kicks, and jumps) I feel pretty confident that the scrunch won't break easily.  When it comes to the fit, they are not a long biker short on me but they don't show any cake spilling out in the back after some movement and I'm a tall gal with a dumpy and lots of shorts usually show a little somethin somethin after I move around. Another plus is they don't create muffin quads on my big thighs and it's very common for shorts to make my legs look chunky.HOWEVER, where I think these shorts lack is the booty region which I find to be pretty important since these shorts have a scrunch in the back for the ""peach"" effect. I will say I like that the scrunch isn't too much like most scrunch butts where it screams ""look at me"" and it doesn't give me a unibutt either. But sadly this scrunch for some reason doesn't flatter my booty at all. I even asked my boyfriend for his opinion and I showed him these shorts and the shorts they are a dupes for one after the other multiple times and he agrees that these shorts don't do it for me but the amplify shorts do. I did notice when I put the shorts side by side the scrunch on the Aurola shorts doesn't go all the way to the gusset crotch seam and I thought that might be the problem but I'm not entirely sure. I mean if these shorts could make my cheeks look amazing then they would be my favorite gym shorts EVAHHHHH! Another con for me is the logo. I do feel a little self-conscious with the words being close to another word ""areo...""... I mean if you know, you know. I hope these changes can be made because I would get them again in a heart beat and probably try the leggings too.","ALMOST the perfect shorts! (Tried on size L, Seal Brown)",2022-01-13,3.0

Awesome product!,0.0,R2811737DA4YPO,Tina Seese,2.0,I really like this head gear. The hat part fits my head perfect. But the hat part is not adjustable and I have an average size head. It probably would be too tight on someone with a large cranium.I like the stretchy fabric beside the ears. Its thinner than the rest of the gear and this helps for hearing in the woods. The facemask part is too loose on the front of my face. There us an adjustment in the back but even at its tightest it's still too loose. So my glasses tend to fog up because it's not tight enough on my nose. Most of the time I wear it down on my chin anyway. If I were to make any changes I would put a moldable metal strip in the nose to help it get tighter across the nose. Also I would extend the adjustment on the back of the facemask towards the sides more to allow it to be made tighter to the face. Overall I'm happy with and will continue to use it for years to come. Love the pattern.,Works well but could use improvments,2020-11-17,4.0,R3E4XDRGZH89N5,Nick9,1.0,I like everything but the sizing.One size does not fit all.The hat is so tight it hurts and it leaves a very deep ring around my head.,One size does not fit all,2019-10-21,3.0

For the amount I paid, you could only buy a pair of fake tits, but this package includes bra form, bra size extender, a blond wig, a comb, and the pair of beautiful tits itself. I haven't much knowledge about buying women's stuff, and it's true. My good will and initiative immediately turned to dust when I was totally mistaken by her over phone calls. She thought I was making fun of her. So without any unpacking the purchased set and the fact that I don't have anyone to send as for gifts cuz it's rather awkward presenting to even the closest opposite sex friends, I have to give the item back for people who really need them, not just for cosplay. And that's another issue and knowledge I learnt about more besides the following story. Later I started to realize something by seriously reading the product name for the first time especially on products which don't relate my hobbies and interests, and I gathered some information from a junior who was male when we co-worked. Recently he has made herself as a women. It shocked me but at the same time I learnt more new things. Before which I vaguely know what TG is. I mostly wondered people were referring to the Telegram app we are using. No discrimination here but just to show my innocence and naiveness, which are no good thing. This was actually the second time I tried to please my GF who is still under both Western and Chinese Medicine Treatments. When I opined that medication won't bring anyone's back physically with a sexy and beautiful full pair of tits, I was again unanimously condemned and despised. For things I have got no knowledge at all,  learnt I should always and had better shut up, because good will can anytime turn into ill intended motions. Therefore to spend the extra CR money, I purchased many other commodities from Amazon like Magnesium, Vitamin D3, (I learnt from Dr Mandell), which she desperately needs; and some tools for acupunctural purposes because I had too many experiences of great and effective healings just via acupuncture treatment and that was once my last resort to one of my past illnesses long time ago, non curable for years by modern clinics and even taking Chinese medical herbal tea. But with the introduction and encouragement by my mom, oblivious of needles piercing pain, I took the first acupunctural treatment session first time in my life. It was that long long time ago even at the time Acupuncture wasn't officially recognized as a legitimate and scientific healing method to allow any registered physicians and practitioners to practice on patients. All in all, I love Amazon of offering platform and often with great big deals to us especially on items and tools for health maintenance and definitive treatment even to some terminal disease, not comparable at all by ordinary clinics in terms of true healing and recovery, just like cancerous cells which will come back on and on that scary and took the life of my beloved idol ONJ away last summer...I suppose this tits set is also a psychological therapy of some kind suggested to people who biologically need sex change. I learnt a lot and appreciations should go to the seller being that kind and amiable all along, and of course nevertheless and as always, great big thanks to our Amazon US!",They are super great good deal of sets.,2023-07-31,5.0,R10E4HGFFD3HHM,SMS,0.0,Breast forms are listed as total weight for two 2026 meaning you need to double the size you would normally get.

This would work particularly well on a trip that includes several different hotels/destinations.

This is my original review.  I first tried to see if I could contact the company directly but was unable to do that.  These headbands are gorgeous but if you can't wear them, what good are they?  I never thought to ask the question prior to purchase about them being too tight and after searching for other reviews on ""tight"", I was not alone.  I even washed all of them (which is why I didn't return to Amazon), didn't dry them in the dryer but hung them and added a weight to them while they air dried.  Didn't help at all.  Still extremely tight and my head isn't large.  I just have a normal sized head.  The picture shows a headband that's comfortable on my head and one of the washed headbands I tried to stretch.  There's about an inch difference.  I'm hoping this company will read this review and make just a small change in size for us normal sized head people.

I am used to the Intensify collection, which are my ALL TIME FAVORITES. Best leggings/shorts ever. Better than Gymsharks who are more restrictive; Intensify fits like a GLOVE, and no difference to the Alphalete leggings if that matters to you. I ordered these, unaware that they were the Dream Collection, and just didn 2019t like them. They are very similar to the DFYNE leggings in material and feel. If you like DFYNE, then this collection is a cheaper dupe, but I really don 2019t like them either so this was a disappointment. They roll up. While the Intensify clings to your skin like a glove, these do not and are more prone to move and have this smoothing effect that 2019s some other material that I don 2019t find breathable. If you 2019re doing squats, lunges, or just walking with thick thighs, it will roll up. They 2019re a lot shorter than Intensify 2019s. Like an inch. This would be fine for me but it already rolls up just by existing in them so you 2019re just rocking a shorter Intensify x2. Other than that, beautiful colors. They 2019re more vibrant than Intensify 2019s. I got the pink and asphalt grey and theyre lovely in color but I 2019d just lounge in them than go to the gym. I literally bought the asphault grey to combat the DFYNE grey ones, only to have the same thing. I 2019d just take it into consideration before buying if you are quick to not read the title like I am and just assume they 2019re the same as Intensify.

For the amount I paid, you could only buy a pair of fake tits, but this package includes bra form, bra size extender, a blond wig, a comb, and the pair of beautiful tits itself. I haven't much knowledge about buying women's stuff, and it's true. My good will and initiative immediately turned to dust when I was totally mistaken by her over phone calls. She thought I was making fun of her. So without any unpacking the purchased set and the fact that I don't have anyone to send as for gifts cuz it's rather awkward presenting to even the closest opposite sex friends, I have to give the item back for people who really need them, not just for cosplay. And that's another issue and knowledge I learnt about more besides the following story. Later I started to realize something by seriously reading the product name for the first time especially on products which don't relate my hobbies and interests, and I gathered some information from a junior who was male when we co-worked. Recently he has made herself as a women. It shocked me but at the same time I learnt more new things. Before which I vaguely know what TG is. I mostly wondered people were referring to the Telegram app we are using. No discrimination here but just to show my innocence and naiveness, which are no good thing. This was actually the second time I tried to please my GF who is still under both Western and Chinese Medicine Treatments. When I opined that medication won't bring anyone's back physically with a sexy and beautiful full pair of tits, I was again unanimously condemned and despised. For things I have got no knowledge at all,  learnt I should always and had better shut up, because good will can anytime turn into ill intended motions. Therefore to spend the extra CR money, I purchased many other commodities from Amazon like Magnesium, Vitamin D3, (I learnt from Dr Mandell), which she desperately needs; and some tools for acupunctural purposes because I had too many experiences of great and effective healings just via acupuncture treatment and that was once my last resort to one of my past illnesses long time ago, non curable for years by modern clinics and even taking Chinese medical herbal tea. But with the introduction and encouragement by my mom, oblivious of needles piercing pain, I took the first acupunctural treatment session first time in my life. It was that long long time ago even at the time Acupuncture wasn't officially recognized as a legitimate and scientific healing method to allow any registered physicians and practitioners to practice on patients. All in all, I love Amazon of offering platform and often with great big deals to us especially on items and tools for health maintenance and definitive treatment even to some terminal disease, not comparable at all by ordinary clinics in terms of true healing and recovery, just like cancerous cells which will come back on and on that scary and took the life of my beloved idol ONJ away last summer...I suppose this tits set is also a psychological therapy of some kind suggested to people who biologically need sex change. I learnt a lot and appreciations should go to the seller being that kind and amiable all along, and of course nevertheless and as always, great big thanks to our Amazon US!",They are super great good deal of sets.,2023-07-31,5.0,R10E4HGFFD3HHM,SMS,0.0,Breast forms are listed as total weight for two 2026 meaning you need to double the size you would normally get.

I'm 5'10"" and it's incredibly difficult to find women's workout shorts that aren't leggings and have an inseam greater than 2"", but are still shorts.I have heat and exercise induced urticaria (hives), so I can't wear tight fitting clothing, such a leggings, while exercising.These shorts are comfortable and breathable with deep pockets and adjustable draw string. The length is perfect.My only note about these is the sizing. I'm 5'10"" 145lbs.

They'll be perfect for the under layer when shoveling snow for hours.About the fit: thanks to the company for providing a size chart, but sizing in clothing is always so complicated when ordering online--size chart or not. I see the words ""slim fit"" in the description, and I will automatically size up, because I have broad shoulders. For perspective, I wear a medium in Gudrun Sjoden and a 2XL for a Bella ""slim fit"" shirt. For this order, I referenced the size chart and landed at ""large"" if I were going strictly by those numbers (keep in mind that if I went by the numbers in size charts, I'd be buying too large in Gudrun Sjoden and too small for Bella). I sized up based on the ""slim fit"" cue and ordered the XL. These are very, very roomy. I think I would've been safe at a medium, especially considering the stretchiness of the fiber blend.I will still wear these as comfy pajama shirts and for winter layers, though. The material is pleasing, and I have very sensitive skin.Some companies go as far as to include a short video of one or more models moving in the clothing and will note what their measurements are for reference.
