Thankfully this wasn’t the case. He was able to use the same Sim Card for his iphone 8 plus for his Motorola G Stylus 2022. He called Xfinity and they walked him through the process of setting up his phone. It is working great. There are no issues He loves his phone.

I don’t feel my daughter is old enough/mature enough for a phone. But I believe everyone should have access to music. We tried a mp3 player but it was annoying to put music on. And a really good mp3 player is hundreds of dollars. This was a cheap option and has parental controls. Unfortunately she can turn them off, luckily I would be notified. Proved it to her so she knows. It’s working great so far with Apple Music family plan. When she’s home she can download and look for new songs. On her walk to school or youth programs or doing chores or whatever she can easily listen to music. Slight issue with paring her head phones but that was a headphones issue. So all in all. I recommend if other parents are like me and looking for a easy cheaper way to get their kids music.I did have to make her a google account and then go into parent controls and link it to mine via her phone and then mine. And then downloaded an app on my phone(iPhone) to remotely control. Once I figured that out it was easy.Only small issue was setting her time to the right time zone. It lagged so I spent an hour trying to fix it. And then finally gave up but a few hours later it was magically on the right time zone.Happy with the purchase I got her a screen protector and an otterbox that came in the recommended add ons. Everything fits. So I recommend those products too.Oh and the apps and internet and everything else works well too without a SIM card when hooked only to WiFi. She get 30-1hr a day to surf the web bc she likes googling things. Animals, geology, astronomy, toys, when her shows and movies are going to release, her favorite characters to phone back grounds.She says the camera works really good and she already has a million pictures of our dogs. Next step is printing some.She also researched about the phone it’s self and how to do things. Like we can put in her thump print and mine to access the phone. I guess next she’s gonna research my iPhone to help me lolHer storage is filling up fast so we will be coming to that bridge when soon. Personally I think she needs to delete some photos and videos she made of her tv shows lol. But we have a lot of cloud storage through apple but idk yet how compatible that will be. I’m sure she will research it.Good buy for a WiFi only option! I’m thinking about getting one to keep in my purse for planning rather than my big planner that takes up so much space. And for music so I can not be interrupted during workouts. Bc I miss those days when people knew I was going to be unreachable and understood patience and not everything is an emergency lol.

I am just tired of the most basic needs being so over engineered you have to go to YouTube to get lessons.  I have had this phone for a while so these are not ""first impressions"" after unboxing.Pros:  (1)The green is gorgeous.  Still too dark but really pretty and the finish fantastic; (2) Clarity of calls is great when it doesn't drop you but that could also be the carrier; (3) video phone option is right there as an offer, however, adding people and connecting is a series of steps making it also one of my biggest cons.  It moves in the right direction; (3) I think the battery life is good; (4) doesn't overheat like others; (5) good amount of memory; (6) camera quality is good and so is video for the phone; (7) I have not used the stylus much but when I do, I really like it. just the right amount of pressure.  some you have really press.  not with this.  I think it is pretty good.cons:  there are less cons than pros but really nerve racking.  (1) adding and editing contact is not good.  especially the editing or just viewing it once you've added.  i do keep emails and multiple phone numbers for some people, can't even get to it.  It is a reason why I will never buy this phone again.  I have several; You have to scroll thru the list and tap.  you can't search on the name and have an option.  it just forces you to call.  (2) I use the flashlight.  It is not just a shake. my goodness you have really give it a heave to turn on and off. (3) getting rid of the notifications.  I just turned them off.  to scroll up to press clear is a mess.  it is as if they want to force you to read them all.  the default is on so you may want to adjust setting to turn off and select the ones you want on. (4) like many phones, the screen goes black when you are talking.  It is an act of god to get the screen back and hang up.  the same if you tap on an app or look up something while talking. to get back to the phone screen is a juggle.  should have the phone icon easily assessible to tap and go back into the call app.stop with the shakes, swipes, tilt, swivel overengineering and sometimes just have the option icon availble as well.",Horrible over-designed phones taking simplicity out of the most basic needs like most phones,2023-08-12,3.0

B0B3PSRHHN,Google Pixel 6a - 5G Android Phone - Unlocked Smartphone with 12 Megapixel Camera and 24-Hour Battery - Charcoal,339.99,4.3,5325,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B3PSRHHN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_top?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent,Smartphones,R1VRQQN9Y5ZPRX,2.0,"Great for 3 months, now I hate it",0.0,R11VY82H98QF93,1.0,garbage - sim not recognized after 5 months,0.0,R11GDFWZMT0LM,1.0,"Not as described.

Tech enthusiasts need not apply.However, as a tech enthusiast who bought one of these as a second phone, I could see myself dailying the Pixel 6a without too many regrets.  I mean, I would feel guilty for coming down hard on it in any particular category simply because it's so darn affordable (particularly when it's on sale).  Plus, there's really nothing else in this price range I can recommend to others with any confidence.  What else can you get for around $300 that is this well-rounded?  In the US?  Not much, though you can get some cheapo Motorola phones for less if you're willing to settle for a weak processor, mediocre cameras, an LCD display (rather than OLED), and a cheaper-feeling, all-plastic build.  You'll also have to settle for weaker software support than the Pixel, which guarantees security updates for another 4 years from now (as well as two more Android OS updates after 13).The nearest competitor is probably the Samsung Galaxy A53 (soon to be A54).  It's also on sale regularly, though I've never seen it as low as the 6a has been.  The Sammy does give you a better display (120Hz AMOLED vs 60Hz OLED) and a bigger battery than the Pixel, but it has a weaker Exynos CPU and worse cameras despite the more impressive specs on paper.  I'd take the Pixel 6a hands down, and that's coming from an 11-year Samsung Galaxy fan.Anyway, onto my detailed personal critique of the Pixel 6a...As I said before, I can't really knock it much considering the price point.  HOWEVER, there are a few sore spots that annoy me and will hopefully be improved upon with the upcoming 7a.The first is the display.  While I appreciate the inclusion of an OLED panel at this price, the 60Hz refresh rate makes my eyes bleed while scrolling.  Harsh?  Yeah, but I've been spoiled by 120Hz displays for years now.  Jumping between this and my S22 Ultra regularly makes the difference even more noticeable.  The 7a is supposed to bump it up to 90Hz, which should greatly improve smoothness.  Refresh rate aside, I also find the display to be a bit on the dim side.  Not that it isn't bright enough in most cases (aside from direct sunlight), but even indoors with minimal lighting the display will adjust to about 50% brightness to maintain adequate visibility.  Meanwhile, my Samsung phones (S22 Ultra and old S21+) are only at 25% brightness in the same environment and still somehow appear to be brighter.  And the colors never seem to pop as much on this phone compared to other OLED-equipped phones I've used.  I suppose that's a key difference between OLED and AMOLED.The second issue is the durability of the materials used to make this phone, mainly the plastic on the back panel.  When brand new, the plastic back does an incredible job of imitating the appearance and feel of glass.  But after minimal use (and even inside of a case, as another reviewer pointed out), this material reveals itself to be ridiculously soft and prone to nicks and scratches.  Mine is covered in little pock marks and micro abrasions despite being in a case the majority of its life.  It's so soft that I swear the little nicks in it are probably from dust particles being pressed into it by popping a case on.  Another ding goes to the dated Gorilla Glass 3 covering the display that's also prone to scratches and sounds really thin and hollow when tapped.  I recommend a screen protector.While steady software updates since the phone's release last July have greatly improved the overall user experience, it still suffers from a few hardware-related headaches.  The modem used in this thing (and its siblings) is infamous for being inefficient, having mediocre reception (though I haven't noticed), and creating massive amounts of heat.  Sadly, no amount of updates can remedy that situation.  It's fine as long as you stick to LTE, in my experience.  Enabling 5G pretty much guarantees that your battery will drain much more quickly and that the back of the phone will stay warm at all times.  On the bright side, you can put it in your back pocket and use it as a ""butt warmer"" on cold days.  If you get a second 6a, you can heat both cheeks evenly.  Don't have heated seats in your car?  Problem solved.  Jokes aside, at least the fingerprint reader and random idle battery drain issues that I experienced early on have been fixed.  It's been months since I've gone to bed with 100% battery only to wake up with 65% left for no reason other than ""just Pixel things"" as a friend of mine with a 6 Pro would call little irritating bugs like those.Now that I've done nothing but blast this poor thing in the previous few paragraphs, let me tell you what I think is great about it.For one, I love the size.  While many out there still think it's too large, I think it's perfect.  After handling a behemoth like the S22 Ultra, this one is a pleasure to grasp even while in a case (of which I recommend the Spigen Rugged Armor, but that's another review).  It's just so light and easy to grip compared to what I'm used to.  It's no Zenfone 9 or iPhone 13 Mini, but it feels downright tiny compared to an S22/23 Ultra or Pixel 6/7 Pro.  Folks with small hands or who simply prefer smaller phones will like this one.  This is the compact option in the realm of budget and mid-range phones, as most inexpensive smartphones have 6.5""+ screens for some reason (I guess they're cheaper to make?).The Pixel software perks are probably my second favorite ""feature"" (though I'm not sure if size can be called a feature...well, maybe but nvm).  Being able to see the title and artist of just about any song playing around me at a glance is something I never knew I wanted.  And while I haven't used them personally, the call waiting assistance and Direct My Call (on-screen choices for automated calls) features sound amazing for simplifying a few of life's little annoyances.  I'm sure there's a lot of great things I'm forgetting to mention but those stand out the most for me.Finally, there's the cameras.  Nothing about the hardware here is fancy or premium, or even new.  In fact, the 6a's main image sensor (Sony IMX363) has been used in the Pixel line as far back as the Pixel 3.  What's propping up these tiny, dated image sensors is Google's amazing camera software and image processing.  While the images produced by this combo won't blow you away, you'll be impressed by just how competent and ""honest"" the results are.  The colors and details are very muted and realistic.  If you're fond of the super-colorful, oversharpened, Ultra HDR photos your typical Samsung phone cranks out, you'll be very disappointed by this phone (and Pixels in general) and should look elsewhere.  I actually prefer the main and ultra-wide cameras on this Pixel to my S22 Ultra for the simple fact that it's better at quick, point and shoot photography.  I can whip the 6a out of my pocket, snap a quick photo, and be 100% confident that resulting picture will be serviceable.  I can't say that about any Samsung that I've ever used.  The main con is the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera.  You can zoom up to 7X with the main camera, but your pictures start looking like watercolor paintings at that level of zoom.  I'd go no higher than 3X and even that is pushing it.Other notes to close out this lengthy, rambling review:Speakers are just okay, and the volume slider has to be cranked fairly high to produce enough sound for normal listening.Battery life is fine, but should honestly be better with a 4410 mAh battery onboard.  In a regular day of use for me, I average about 4-5 hours of screen on time with 5G enabled.I can squeeze out an extra hour or two if I disable 5G and stick to LTE, and the phone runs much cooler on average as an added bonus.  I had a OnePlus 8T with a similarly-sized 4500 mAh battery and snapdragon 865 that could get up to 8 hours of SoT (with 5G disabled, as well), so I feel like the Tensor G1 isn't the most efficient SoC around.Charging is slow, coming from someone who used to daily a OnePlus with 65W Warp Charging.  Still, you can fully charge it in less than 2 hours from nearly-dead.  Could be worse, I guess.  Also, there's no wireless charging on the 6a.As far as performance goes, I can't complain about it in daily use scenarios.  It feels very responsive when opening and navigating my usual apps (Gmail, Twitter, twitch, YouTube, Amazon, etc.).  I'm not a phone gamer, so I can't comment on gaming performance though I imagine that it gets rather hot in a short period of time as that's just what the Tensor does.I've already stated repeatedly that I can recommend this phone to just about anyone because it does just about everything well enough for the average person.  However, the 7a is on the horizon and is expected to bring a 90Hz display, wireless charging, the Tensor G2 from the Pixel 7, and better cameras for a similar RRP.  While it won't be as affordable as the discounted 6a when it launches this summer, I imagine we'll be seeing it in the $300 range by Black Friday.  So you may want to wait for that one unless you need a new phone right now.  Still, the 6a at its current price is an absolute bargain, in my honest opinion.","The best all-around phone at this price point (in the US, at least)",2023-03-22,4.0,R2IRNTEPVHZ7G4,TS,70.0,"Update 2: Phone would not connect to mobile network!  Would connect for a few minutes and then drop mobile/data/gps connection, it was such a bummer.  After trying to fix it for a week and even changing mobile carriers, nothing worked- I decided to finally just return the phone and get a new one (same model).  To my surprise, I have had none of the issues with the replacement.  It shipped in a shoebox-size box with no cushioning, which I did not appreciate.  But none of the overheating issues (gets warm but not nearly as bad), none of the issues connecting, etc.So, as an actual functioning phone, and not a cause of intense stress: pretty solid?  Not in love with it relative to the original cost, but it looks pretty (I got the sage), and it works about as well as I would expect.  Fingerprint scanner is not amazing, but seems to be working noticeably better since update.  I have had to redo the finger scan to get it to work.  Also the limit of 4 fingers seems arbitrary, but I have both of my thumbs and pointer fingers which is good enough.Battery life is a bit of a disappointment!  Lasts about a day, and not necessarily a full 24 hours.  Not an issue for me but was hoping for a little extra.  The battery saver mode works pretty well it seems, I don't even notice the difference when it is in use.  Screen is bright enough to view during daylight hours at full brightness, and looks good.  Camera works well, and even low-light photos come out pretty decent.I would prefer a regular audio jack, but have not had any issues other than having to pony up $7 for a USBC/3.5mm adapter.  I do wonder about the life of the port, since the power and audio jack are doing double-duty.Verdict: Pretty good phone!  It ruined my life, briefly.______Update1: Google pushed out an update around 8/4, which means they knew about the issues that people like me were having for a while.Phone still gets very warm, but overheating issue is much better. Does not seem to get quite as hot, and also it does not shut down the way it used to. It used to happen several times per day in any number of situations, but I've only seen it give me the overheating warning once in the last several days, when I was using the camera for about a half an hour. This is still a flaw, and not an issue I've run into with other smartphones.General complaints include the fact that I do not like the fingerprint reader. I'm upgrading from a Motorola Moto G5 S Plus that I've had for about four and a half years. The Pixel 6A fingerprint reader is built into the screen, and maybe that's why it is slower. If you are not used to a more responsive fingerprint reader you may not know the difference.Overall, I am not wowed.  Having dealt  with the overheating issue, it makes me suspicious about the life of the battery, in case any damage was done by the overheating processor.  At this point I am likely to keep the same model, but would want to be shipped a replacement unit just in case.  Not a strong recommendation.Original:I will try update this in a week or so, but it's not looking good so far.I have an overheating issue, which is apparently somewhat common with these phones.  Luckily I bought a case for it, because it's physically uncomfortable to hold without one.When the phone gets too hot, any number of bad things happen - cellular/data quality begins to degrade, or the phone will just shut down on its own.I have gotten some  irritating Google messages warning me about my phone overheating, and then giving me advice on what to do about it. I am not using it to stir nacho cheese, or take pictures of the inside of an active volcano. I'm not even playing games at all or watching videos that much - I'm doing regular cell phone things, and my phone doesn't like it.  The ""tips"" Google wants to give me are particularly irritating, because they already know this overheating is an issue, and they're attempting to pretend like it is a user problem and not a hardware / software issue.Anyway, I'm going to give it a few more days to see if the issue persists, but I'm very disappointed so far.  I may have to send it back in case this particular phone happens to be a dud.",Seems perfectly cromulent. (update),2022-08-04,3.0

Great colors.+ It will transfer most of your apps from your old phone if you have the USB cable. Great/Easy first time setup!+Great stereo Speakers, great sound very loud and clear!+ It corrects grammar as well as spelling ...Now the Minuses:- There isn't hardly any apps to run audio or video files so I had to install VLC but still cannot see the audio files while playing them,  unless I use the volume control and grab it before it disappears.-The screen comes ON with slightest movement (despite the fact that I changed the Settings and told it Not to)! Once I had this phone in my pocket. Later I saw a MSG on screen saying ""The system has turned your Flashlight off because it stayed on for over 30 minutes""! So the phone screen turned on in my pocket  by itself, while walking and then somehow turned the flashlight on without me knowing! I was Not impressed!- The photos taken by camera, take too much space! I cannot take pictures which are less then 3+ MB! No matter what settings I use, it only goes up...up to 16 MB for a single photo?!- If you are used to Samsung phones then this phone will take some getting used to!

The phone access, is to wipe the screen vertically and some other differences.-There are no email program beside Gmail and no internet browser except for google!-I had to go back using my old phone because of these little annoyances!I do not use the fingerprint on any phone because if your finger is wet (or it's raining) or sweaty then it will Not work!

I made a mistake buying this one and I don't think anyone should buy this phone. I swapped it for the Samsung S23, so I'll compare it with that in this review. It's $250 more, which I did NOT want to pay. I'm not a spender, but I guarantee you, save up some more and treat yourself better. You use your phone every day, trust me you want a better one than the 7a.(1) Battery life and charging. awful. This is the main reason you don't want this phone. This phone has 18W wired charging (roughly 2 hours to charge) and 7.5W wireless charging (roughly 4 hours to charge). The battery lasts about 4-5 hours. If you are like most people and use your phone for 2-4 hours a day, this phone WILL die before nighttime. Do you always want to carry a charger? Do you want the anxiety of worrying when you don't have a charger? Even if you think you'll be fine, what might start as a decent battery will be unusable after 18-24 months of use. That'll be an $100 new battery or entirely new phone.Pixel 7a: 18W wired charging and 7.5 wireless. Battery endurance test: 76hrSamsung S23: 25W wired charging and 15W wireless. Battery endurance test: 101hrComically, the Samsung S23 has a 12.5% SMALLER battery, yet lasts 32% longer.(2) Speed of the device. Google makes its own processors, with the Tensor 2 chip in this one. I expected very good performance given that it's the same processor they use in their Google Pixel  7 Pro phone. The processor is FINE for most things, but gaming is subpar. As a normal user you could get by with this, but just know it's SLOW and KILLS THE BATTERY. I used Geekbench, an app that determines phone performance, to compare this with the S23.Pixel 7a (Google Tensor 2 chip): 3191S23 (Snapdragon Gen 2 chip): 4950 (155% difference)Here's the GFXBench score, a frames-per-second stress test that shows game performance:Pixel 7a: 62fpsS23: 110fps (177% difference)(3) Cameras: excellent, of course. Pixels have some of the best cameras in the industry. You might think this phone is worth it for the cameras and it is, so long as you have a charger with you everywhere.Pixel 7a: Ultrawide and regular camera. Takes pictures that look less premium, but are more true to life and have the best detail. The camera also comes with some crazy AI editing features that Google loves to advertise.S23: Ultrawide, regular, and telephoto (3x zoom) camera. Takes pictures you might expect from a professional camera. Very contrasty, lots of colors, better camera performance. As an amateur photographer, I prefer the S23 because I like color and contrasty.(4) Software. Both these phones will have 3-5 years of upgrades, thanks to new Google and Samsung policies. Google Pixels have the best of the best Android features, simply because Google owns Android. Samsung uses a modified version of Android called One UI (5.1). This one is up for personal preference. One UI has WAY more features, controls, settings, etc, but it can be a little intimidating. Most people either love or hate Samsung's One UI.In summary--------------I spent the $250 more for the Samsung S23. The 7a was one of the worst phones I've ever owned and the S23 is hands-down the best phone I've ever owned. The price really hurts your wallet, but if you use your phone every day, the little things add up. You might think you can live with the awful battery of the 7a, but after a year or two I guarantee you, you'll want it replaced. Would you rather buy a new phone/battery in two years or buy a better phone today that might last you 3-5 years? You'll save money AND have a better phone.Please, please do not buy the 7a. The S23 might not be the right price for everyone, but look at these alternatives before you make the mistake of buying the 7a:- Samsung S23, a flagship, best of the best, but much more expensive.- Google Pixel 6a, last year's model. Better battery, slightly worse cameras, much cheaper.- Google Pixel 7, almost a year old and can probably get it for a similar price. Larger, better cameras, better battery.- Samsung A54, the mid-range Samsung. Comparable performance to the Pixel 7a with better battery but worse cameras and trade-offs in other areas.","Horrific battery life, be cautious before you buy",2023-06-30,2.0

Unlike many people I can't justify spending more than $200 on a phone that is likely to be dropped/broken/malfunctioning within a couple years. Unfortunately that means digging through bargain bin phones. As far as this one goes, its pretty good overall. My most recent budget phone before this was a Samsung Galaxy A03sPros:- Much, MUCH faster than the A03s in every possible way- Battery life almost as good as the A03s while still being way faster- Stylus works pretty well and is nice for precision use cases- Screen is real sharp and generally bright enough. 90hz is useless to me so I turn it to 60hz to save batteryOkay:- The camera is 12MP, not ""52"" or whatever they stamp on there. This reminds me of the old days of computer monitors where the size as marketed was edge to edge of the case instead of the screen itself. It has aggressive filtering applied to every photo no matter what settings you change. I am not trying to be a pro photographer with my phone so this doesnt bother me much but I wish they'd just put a non-filtered 12MP camera instead of all this silly marketing ""AI"" mess.Cons:- The moto firmware is mediocre. The ""peek"" function would be better if it just showed the normal lockscreen but no, they had to go and make a less accessible, more annoying version. This makes their 'tap to wake' function, that I normally love on phones, far less useful.","Overall good phone, fast hardware.

While yes, there are other uses for the stylus and paintng with the stylus is fun, it just wasn't going to be useful enough to me without functional writing. It's like writing with a very bad credit card signature machine no matter how I tried! I also tried to look up if there were ways to refine it, but was unsucessful with that.*The size of the phone is just a little taller than the moto g pwer 2021 and 2022, yet I found it to be just a little too big and awkward.The features I liked about the phone were:The sound quality using speaker phone was really good, (especially compared to the moto g power 2022, which is bad in that respect).It wasn't very slow, was reasonably fast, faster than some though not great!Overall its a bummer this newer model (2022) moto phones are not just 'not' better, but worse than the year before Moto g power (2021) when it comes to basic features they're bragging about and designed for (ie the processing or operating system being slow, and the stylus feature not workng well for writing notes!)",Not better and not great,2023-07-11,3.0

For the same price as taking this to a local shop and having them fix my Pixel I could just buy this phone and have Google fix the issue for free.After a few days of use, I have to admit that I could totally daily drive this phone. It's got a surprisingly good screen. The 90hz setting makes it pretty smooth and the colors and brightness are decent. It fades pretty fast at angles, but I'm not going to get picky about that for $150 (it was on sale).As far as performance, it's really good. Coming from a flagship android phone to this, I notice a hiccup or stutter here and there, but it's 80% of the way there for a quarter of the price. The camera is pretty good too, not flagship quality, but far from a potato. It's got a mono speaker which is lacking a bit in bass, but unless you've got an iPhone I think every phone is going to be lacking there.So, if you've got $200 to spend (or less as I got it at a $50 discount here on Amazon), this is an amazingly good bargain.

Nice screen. Nice build quality. More than fast enough. Lots of storage.  Audio ain't great.  Not very loud on headphones.  I know this depends on the headphones, but my free Samsung A-20 pushed my Sennheiser earbuds better.  Find an EQ app to boost the volume. Streaming audio and video has always worked great.  And downloaded video is perfect.  Gotta love those Pug videos. And Free Clarence!Oxygen 12 OS is okay.  What it does, it does well enough. Unfortunately, they won't update to OxygenOS 13, since it originally shipped under 11.  So I guess my one update was done in the box.  Settings menus are kind of a mess.  I often have to go online to figure out how to make an adjustment.  It took 15 minutes to find out how to change the image on my lock screen (it's under wallpapers, not home & lock screen, not security, not display). Can't comment on the UI, since I run a shell (Windows Metro, believe it or not), but it runs that without any problems or slowdown.Not so good is the fingerprint scanner.  At least half the time I end up on the password screen.  I've reset it a couple times and it doesn't get better.  Really annoying is that it never actually closes any apps, and it has a bunch of apps it always opens, whether you want them to open or not. Especially Google apps, which they also won't let you delete or even ""park.""  So you'll need to download an app killer and run it regularly.  Right now there are 35 open apps. About 5 of which I didn't use.  That may be Android, but it's on their phone.Big plus is battery and charging.  This thing is a beast.  Two full days of power, even with Zoom meetings, texting, and browsing.  Recharges in minutes, not hours.  About 75% in less than an hour.  Maybe 90 for a full charge.  I almost wish it wasn't so nicely built and good looking.  I don't dare risk not using a gel case, in case I might hurt it!I had to torture myself to spend $230 on this - and I'm glad I did.  If I were willing to spend $900+ on a phone, I'd buy a OnePlus in a minute.  I'm not, but if OnePlus would like me to review their latest model...",Feels like a better phone than you should get for the price.,2023-08-21,4.0,R2FY1D6HGI0BT4,D T,18.0,"Pros:- micro SD slot- 3.5mm headphone jack- Easily unlockable bootloader- Easily rootable- Still receiving security updates- Generally decent hardware all around- Camera takes decent quality photos & videos- Works well with T-Mobile's networks, including 5G- Pretty responsive for the most part, with occasional minor lag Cons:- Overly aggressive task killer, and it's a *major* con- Software in general, is subpar- Price - $150 would be more reasonable, unless the software is improved- Fingerprint scanner is under screen - in my experience, these aren't as responsive as ones on a power button, or other dedicated hardware location- Front camera location could be better.  I like to cover my camera with tape when I'm not using it, and it's more difficult to do that when the camera is inside the screen - as in, the screen is displaying stuff around the camera lens.  I'd prefer a camera that's under the screen, and but is not displaying anything above it, so it's easier to tape up.Review:I've always avoided OnePlus, because despite their motto of ""Never Settle"", their major lineup has always seemed exactly like settling to me - no microSD slot, nor 3.5mm headphone jack, nor NFC, and other missing basic features, even before the industry sadly started killing some those features off in most phones.  Unfortunately, it's been harder to find phones that meet some of my basic criteria that I just mentioned.  So while I was looking for a new phone, I was pretty interested in trying a OnePlus phone that finally had those things.  For the most part, the phone works great. Rooting was easy enough. The phone is still getting security updates. Calls are clear.  Camera quality is not great, but not terrible. The phone does run a little slow at times, but is pretty responsive for the most part.  HOWEVER, there's a major problem, in my opinion, with the software.  It is the sole reason for me knocking 2 of the stars off. The phone's task killer is stupidly aggressive.  If you don't know, this is the thing on Android that usually manages what apps you have running on your phone, in the foreground and in the background. Whatever app you're looking at & using, is likely in the foreground.  Whatever apps are running, but you're not actively using, such as a music or video player, is likely in the background.  On this phone, that thing is so aggressive, that I can seldom have one app running in the background, let alone more than that.  Trying to play music from a music player, while trying to browse the internet?  Expect your music player in the background to get slaughtered within a few minutes, because the phone's task killer won't allow it.  Switching between 2-3 apps while multi-tasking?  1 or 2 of them will likely get killed, probably resetting whatever you were doing in them.  As you might guess from my comment about rooting, I'm a power user.  I know my way around Android probably way better than the average user.  Before I even rooted, I was suffering from this issue.  I've tried setting every option in the phone that I could find, to not kill certain apps in the background.  Yet none of them seem to have any effect on disabling this ""feature"".  There are root-only solutions for this type of issue, but they also don't fix the problem on this phone. From hours of researching online, I'm not the only one with this complaint.  It seems like whatever is causing this aggressive task killer behavior, is ingrained deep in OnePlus's badly designed operating system. From what I've read, this aggressive task killing behavior is also oddly normal for OnePlus's operating systems on most of their phones, which I wish I would've known before buying this phone.  Also, the music player is just one example.  There are various other apps that I like to setup to run in the background and do certain things.  And they keep closing & failing, because of the overly aggressive task killer.  I think maybe it's OnePlus's way of hiding the phone's slow performance, by not allowing anything in the background to slow it down.  It is such a massive shame, because this one major issue, absolutely ruins the phone for me.  $300 for a phone with an issue like this, is an absurd price. I think $150 is more reasonable, until this issue is fixed.  I've used plenty of $100 phones, that work better, without the need to kill apps so aggressively. Some of the customizability options in the OnePlus system's settings are also more limited than the average Android phone that I've used, so the software just seems to be poorly designed in general.I really want to support companies that continue producing phones with micro SD cards, 3.5mm headphone jacks, easy rootability, heck, removable batteries, if we could get those back.  Those features are becoming harder & harder to find, and I consider them essential, far more than some gimmick on other phones, like a 100MP camera, or having 4 camera lens. But unfortunately, despite the decent hardware on the OnePlus Nord, the software still very much feels like settling.","Decent hardware, horrible software",2023-05-28,2.0

I was looking for a basic smartphone that he could use for entertainment, and the TCL 30 Z seemed like a good option. It's affordable and has a lot of features that kids will enjoy, such as a large display.The display is big and bright, which is great for watching videos and playing games. The battery lasts all day long, even with my son using it for hours at a time.However, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, the phone comes with a lot of pre-installed apps that you may not want your child to have access to. These apps can slow down the phone. I had to spend some time uninstalling the apps that I didn't want.Second, the charging speed is a bit slow. It takes about two hours to fully charge the phone. If your child is using the phone a lot, they'll need to make sure to plug it in overnight.Third, the phone can be a bit laggy when scrolling through screens. This is likely due to the pre-installed apps and the slow charging speed.the TCL 30 Z is a decent option for kids who need a basic smartphone for entertainment. It's affordable and has a lot of features that kids will enjoy. Even if my child breaks the phone, I won't feel bad about spending the money. It's only 30 dollars.

I got them on sale for $12, and am very satisfied with that (got Rosegold version). Tested on a call and they work great. Podcasts/spoken recordings are fine. Music is also fine for the price and ease of wearing. No complaints really. I actually like the control buttons on these better than my AirPods, which can sometimes get confused on skipping or stopping. There is an 'EQ' button which isn't top notch (don't hear that much difference between types), but is usable (goes through 6 music-type choices: Pop, Rock, Vocal, Jazz, Bass, Classic). A nice little added feature.Would I pay $25 for them? If I weren't watching every penny, yeah probably! They're just more comfortable than the pods in my ears all the time. (And they are sufficiently comfortable, too.) I'm trying to get back to listening to music instead YouTube podcasts all the time. LOL And these are definitely helping for that. They just feel like I should be listening to music with them, you know?I only started using them today, so no idea yet on battery life yet. But they did turn themselves off when I forgot to (leaving them unused for a while). So that's good. :)UPDATE: After several weeks of use, I can add a bit more: 1) The range on these are fantastic. I can leave my phone at one end of our house and walk to the other and suffer no degradation of signal at all. I sometimes forget where I left the phone! (Our house is a little under 1500 sq ft., so not a mansion, but my earbuds don't always reach that far.) 2) I have yet to find the end of a charge, so it does last a good long time. 3) Audio on the mic is fine; no problem using it on phone calls, as told to me by those I'm calling. They always report that they can hear me fine.",Excellent for the price!,2023-09-17,5.0,R2O5CH6AUO3RWN,Breana Dee,0.0,"I’m giving this one alllllmost 4 stars. It would be 5 if the sound was louder cause everything else is great but my MAIN focus on these types of headphones is sound volume and sound quality. Although the quality is nice, the volume is a 7/10 for me. But, what sorta makes up for it is the fact there’s a button on one of the side that lets you chose from “pop, bass, jazz, classic, local and more” and I like the pop and bass one. But ultimately I’m still on the search for headphones that are completely sound proof and I can’t even hear myself singing lol so if you like to listen to music at a “normal” volume, these are great",4 stars,2023-10-04,3.0

Yes, needed more lighting when taking pictures at night.  At day time the photo looked pretty good, sharp image, good colors without flash.I enjoyed watching a video on the phone. good and vibrant colors.  The phone has a big screen, allowing me to have a good view.The volume was sharp, I do have max the vol in a noisy environment.  I have no problem watching movies in the dark with a lamp turned on.  Slightly hard to watch a movie,read email or text under the sun. Under a slight shade, works good!.The thermometer was awesome. It took a pretty accurate temperature on my forehead or wrist.For the 5150 mAh battery, I only needed to charge the phone at the end of the day.There is one slot for SD card for addition storage and 2 SIM cards.Cons:Multiple apps opened - I do encounter a lag when 4 apps or more are running in the background.. Maybe it's only 4gb Ram.On Day 7, had a problem while watching a movie. The screen was frozen and voice still ongoing. Then making weird sound.  Another problem, the phone started to reboot itself for no reason.  The phone restarted while I was watching a movie, on to the browser, on a call, typing a text or when I am using 3-4 apps. The phone also had restarted 3-4 times daily that I have noted even without using the phone.My final thoughts - it is a great phone, a nice feel in my hand with a good price.  Gave 4 stars because the phone was restarting itself and it can be frustrating. Hoping new updates may help with the problem.

It worked great. I purchased a nice leather case for it and kept the phone clean and optimised. Then July 7th 2023 the phone just went blank overnight. No power at all. I tried to do a factory reset, but the phone was not responding to anything. I was shocked I couldn't believe that overnight the phone just totally turned into a paperweight. It was working great before I went to sleep. I bought another umidigi a11 because I really like the phone. I was planning on buying a umidigi Bison at some point. I received the new a11 it worked for 5 days and then the screen started flickering going crazy. I performed a factory reset and the screen still continued to flash and strobe. I reached out to Amazon not knowing how their return process works. They were awesome they sent me another new phone the next day and emailed me a UPS label to return the defective phone. I received my third umidigi a11 and set it up. It works great except for the display. On a gray screen you can see a big rectangle the length of the phone with a border around the edges. You don't notice it watching a movie so much but you see it every time there's a gray screen and it's highly annoying. The phone that I had previously, before the screen totally went bad ,also had the same Gray rectangle. I don't know what's going on with these phones. I was so excited and happy with my first one. I wanted to bye a umidigi Bison, but now I'm Leary to buy another Umidigi phone. I really thought that umidigi was going to be my go to brand forever . I'm not so sure anymore. I'm thankful for Amazon for the speedy replacement of my phone. I am just worried that this phone will be another dud.",Highly disappointed.,2023-08-03,1.0

Last 2 phones I had were a Galaxy S8 for personal use and an iPhone 13 Pro for work, and this blows both out of the water and is replacing both. I've only had it for a couple weeks and I could gush about it much more than anyone would read, but its a great phone. Great hardware, great software. I'm still getting used to how big it is, I actually prefer smaller phones but I figured I'd give this a try. It has a lot of great features and good software design though that compensate for the size and make it still one hand useable. The pen is fun too.This phone has so many features I've watched dozens of those ""50 things you didn't know you could do with the S23 Ultra"" type YouTube videos and am still learning new things. Its still super user friendly, you can pick it up and do all the things you'd expect a smartphone to do no problem, but then you can also get really into it and discover a ton of awesome extra features it has to play with.Fit and finish is nice too, I got the green and I wish it was more green and less grey, but it still looks and feels nice. Very premium feel with the nice glass, metal sides, and whatever material the back is, I don't even know.Seamless integration with both Samsung and third party peripherals like headphones, watches, etc. I think Samsung is catching up to Apple in terms of its ecosystem integration, plus unlike apple it works just as well with third party and other android devices as it does other Samsung devices.Awesome phone, I'll have this one a long time I think",Most beautiful phone I've ever used,2023-08-05,5.0,RZ6VWTJR8Y2Q8,Derrick H.,0.0,"I've had this phone a day so I obviously haven't had it long enough to give a full, educated review of it. I'm writing this review because I will most likely be returning it.First off, I'm coming from an iPhone SE and you could easily hide that phone inside this one. I knew it was big, but this might be too big.Coming from iPhone where everything is intuitive, I am struggling to do even basic stuff on this phone like see the weather without having to just look it up in a browser. A lot of this stuff is to be expected and I don't knock off points for not knowing the UI. It just feels like it could be a little easier for new Android users to figure things out. The absence of a home button will take a lot of getting used to.The fingerprint scanner works great. So great that I had my wife try to open my phone using her print, which it didn't work. It's just sometimes I can barely touch the scanner and it will open. I think this is great. I haven't set up face recognition as it's a feature I just can't see messing with.I thought that it being an Android phone, using Google apps would be seamless. But I'm having to log into each Gmail account and re-log any time I log out, even though on the computer, I'm logged into all of my Google accounts and can switch between them easily. Same with YouTube. So far, this phone is acting like it's day one every time I want to switch to another account.Battery life has been good so far. It had 50% when it arrived and it's down to 42% after almost 24 hours. But battery life on all new phones is miraculous, though. A year from now, it will struggle to make it 4 hours of heavy use without needed topped up. But topping up isn't something Samsung thought about as you don't even get a charger included. I won't be able to charge this phone until my I order or go buy a charger. I didn't see this when I bought it, so I'm to blame for that ignorance, but when I read it was to cut down on e-waste, I knew that was a load of bull. It's the same reason my wife's Kia didn't come with a spare tire: everything is a-la-cart these days. My old device, packaging, charger and phone case are now waste, but you're concerned about ONLY the charger? I can't reuse my charger. Because Apple has to be a special snowflake and use lightning. Which they are doing away with I believe, so I would have had to buy a new charger even with Apple because everyone is moving to this new format of giving you most of the things you need, but not everything.The phone is good I guess. It looks amazing. You set the resolution between 720, 1080, or 1440 to save on battery. It's snappy and fast. Calls are clear but I was on Wi-Fi at the time so who knows what it sounds like out in the wild. Plenty of customization options ofc. I like that it has a reboot option instead of power off only like the SE had. The problem is, unless I'm doing it wrong, the button combo to power it down, is the same as taking a screenshot. I've taken quite a few needless screenshots while trying to master the timing to get to the power down/reboot option to pop up. Supposedly you can take screenshots by waving your palm across the face, but even after enabling this feature (which is off by default and in your s-pen settings), I haven't been able to make it work even once.I'd say this phone is powerful enough for desktop gaming and probably has a lot of content available for it, but this charger thing that everyone is moving to needs to be pushed back against.Having customers buy a charger from a 3rd party doesn't cut down on waste, it just fattens their profit margin.",One grand for a phone and I still have to buy a charger???,2023-09-27,3.0

It's quite frustrating.  It runs android 13, but connectivity tops out at 4G.  Considering how highly touted the camera is, the photo quality is a HUGE letdown. It's very grainy, and when you change settings, the difference is minuscule, or non-existent. Video quality is middle-of-the-road.  The phone itself seems like it's very well constructed, feels good in the hand, & is quite light compared to some of the other phones I've had in recent years. It doesn't drop calls, but oftentimes, it doesn't even connect to start with.  I have purchased phones from lesser-known brands over the past few years -- Lenovo, Blackview, TCL, for example, just to try and show people that the most popular phones/brands are all about status & image, because they don't outperform the majority of the ""little man"" brands.  This time, unfortunately, I simply cannot make that statement unequivocally.  Life has been hectic lately, as I recently bought a house, & there have been a lot of little things needing my attention, so the 30 day return window completely got away from me... otherwise, this would be going back. As for those who say, ""Well, you got what you paid for!"", that doesn't hold true across the board. I have been pleasantly surprised quite a few times!  I must add that I am a burn survivor, so my facial features don't get picked up easily for facial recognition. I also don't have fingers anymore, so the fingerprint sensor doesn't have anything to pick up. I didn't feel it was fair to take a star off my overall review because I can't speak as to the quality & effectiveness of these features.","Android 13, but only 4G",2023-09-25,3.0

As a long time user of Samsung and Pixel phones on the Android side of things, this is honestly a better phone in almost every way possible- aside from that camera.The unit I received was brand new as described, and it was in perfect working condition. I was able to easily add my SIM card to it and transfer my Google Fi number to this phone in just a few minutes. (Note, this phone does not support eSIM, so you will need a physical SIM card to set it up.) The setup was also very easy and simple to do and has the same data and app transfer option as on other android devices.Once set up, it was still on Android 12 by default, but I did have a large series of updates that took about an hour to fully get it up to the latest release of Android 13. The phone had approximately 7 updates in this time frame.Software:Once fully updated, OxygenOS was a breath of fresh air. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was using a version of Android that was more customizable than ever as well as giving the default Android-like experience a whole new form. OxygenOS was cleaner and more modern than any other Android skin I've seen, with a translucent app and notification drawer, subtle icon animations when expanding the quick settings, and so much more. Even the built-in clock has a red color for the ""1"" digits as a subtle nod to OnePlus itself. While the entire skin feels smoother than any Android experience I have ever had, it is also the most customizable. You can change the icons to a number of different shapes, sizes, styles, and colors and the same goes for the software color themes, home page screen transitions, the always on display, and even the battery icon style itself. It's an endlessly adjustable software to reflect the style you like the most and I really, really like that. When it comes to ringtones it even has a much higher amount of ringtones I've ever seen preloaded on a phone, and the haptics are out of this world as each ringtone has haptics that respond identically to the tune that is playing. It's just that great and I haven't even mentioned the side quick app drawer or the shelf features. Also, despite being a physical switch, the phone also has a three-way slider above the power button that can instantly switch your phone between Ring, Haptic, and Silent modes as well as muting your audio automatically. It's similar to the silent mode switch on an iPhone but better, in my opinion.Performance:When it comes to performance I was very impressed. Despite the fact that I got the 8GB of RAM model, the phone was snappy and blazing fast. Apps launched in no time and apps scrolled with perfect butter-y action with that 120Hz display. My games were lag free in all that I tried and I am just overall very pleased with the performance.Display:In this phone is an LTPO gen 2 OLED panel that is one of the best I've seen aside from a Samsung phone. Not only is it able to automatically adjust its frame rate to conserve battery life, but it does it in a way that you wouldn't otherwise notice. There is no hitching or stuttering or weird glitches from the display shifting its frame rate and it is just a flawless experience. Not only that, the display is incredibly vivid, detailed, and bright and I didn't notice any color shifting like on some lower quality OLED panels. The HDR looks great, and the screen is super immersive. You will not be disappointed when playing games or watching content as it is one of the best displays I have seen. However, I am not the biggest fan of the curved edges as I prefer a flat display but the edges of the display are not too troublesome or as curved as some others.Battery Life:At first I was slightly worried that the battery wasn't going to be good as despite its exceptionally fast charging speeds, my phone was depleting charge extremely fast the first few days that I had it. In the days since, the battery has held up much better with somedays giving me as much as triple the screen on time compared to when I first got it. I assume that this is from the adaptive battery functionality finally optimizing itself based on how I use my phone and what apps I run, but it is something to take note of as you must give the phone a few days to get this kind of battery life. Presently, I am able to use it all day with about 30% charge left around bedtime. Now, the most standout feature about this phone is its charging capabilities. From a near 0 charge, this phone can almost completely get back to 100% in just 30 minutes which is crazy to me as I am used to phones taking anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours to fully charge. So, if you just need a quick charge, just plug this in for a few minutes and you'll get a couple hours of screen time. It's that fast. If you prefer to charge wirelessly, it will also support insanely fast wireless charge speeds, but you have to make sure your wireless charger is capable of putting out the necessary wattage.Speakers:The speakers on this phone are very good. While they don't get as loud as I would like, they do deliver fuller and more natural sounding audio compared to other phones I have used. Voices sound crisp and clear, and music sounds detailed and rich. The only disappointment I have with the speaker aside from the volume level is that the bass is not very noticeable, but this isn't that much of an issue to me. The speakers deliver what I would describe as a mostly ""flat"" or otherwise balanced sound EQ.Build Quality:This is also without a doubt one of the most comfortable phones I have ever used. Even though I usually put a case on all of my devices, this is probably the only one I would consider using without one. The back of the phone has this unusual but incredibly well done powdered granite-like feel as the frosted matte finish is soft and soothing against the hands. It doesn’t look or feel like glass at all as it feels more like a soft stone, and the best part is this finish doesn’t leave fingerprints of any kind which means you don’t need to constantly wipe it down. It also gives it a slight amount of grip to hold as it isn’t slippery. Despite not being a fan of curved edges, the design of the phone is not too narrow or too wide which allows it to fit almost perfectly in my hands as if it was naturally designed for them. The phone is also very light weight despite all that is packed inside of it, and I just really think the design, feel and weight of the phone is one of the best I have ever used.Camera:We are finally at the weakest part of the entire phone. Despite the Hasselblad partnership, the cameras on this phone just can't quite live up to the photos taken on other Android phones such as the Pixel series or Galaxy Ultra phones. It gets even worse when you compare the selfie cameras as the photos taken by this phone are extremely soft and lack detail. While the rear camera can still take some fairly good photos, it is more of a ""luck of the draw"" as sometimes it will capture a good photo and other times it will not. Videos are even worse. While most android phones have never really been that good when it comes to video, there is something noticeably wrong with the videos I record with this phone. It's like all the saturation got turned up to a 1000 as the colors are way over done compared to real life in addition to all the shadow details being crushed with nothing but pure black. It's still usable to make a quick post, but I would not recommend using it to record videos for content creation. Overall, it is not the worst camera by any means as it is still fairly good, but it just doesn't live up to my expectations.Overall, this is an excellent phone that when on sale, I would say is better than almost anything else aside from the camera. At the current sub-500 cost, the performance, battery life, display quality, and software experience is unrivaled. The only thing that hurts the value in my opinion is the camera, but it excels in almost every other category. I highly recommend it.",Better than Almost Every Flagship Phone,2023-09-10,4.0,R2QXDXGCOFG39C,three_legs,3.0,"First off I like this camera. 30x is actually amazing.However, without access to MSM and edl firehose etc I am kinda disappointed.Basically if you brick your device doing any development there are two options open it up to do a hardware jumper bypass or send it back to OnePlus. The new MSM tool uses a unique key pair for each phone that links to oopos servers for the private key. So you need oopo credentials. While I'm sure someone will find a way eventually I'm not able to provide much in the way of research with my current situation. Their merger with oopo has been a failure there's things that I just can't tolerate with oos like the relatively weak encryption and security standards. Which are admittably Android standard. I apologize to Amazon but I'll have to send this one back I'll probably be buying an even older OnePlus.",Read if you're a developer.,2023-06-17,3.0

But so far no issues.",Really good phone under $150,2023-09-25,4.0,R1JP7IM51TIEKQ,Ro Jo,22.0,"I currently have a Samsung Note 9, which was released in 2018 (it is relevant to this review, I promise), but I'm not happy with the direction Samsung is going with their newer higher end phones (taking away expandable storage, taking away some sensors, etc) so I was looking to get a feel for a new phone company.We currently have two TCL TV's that we love so I decided to give TCL a try. I am testing a new unlocked TCL 30XL (2022) outside on a sunny day right next to my Note 9. Right off the bat, it's very hard to see the screen on the 30XL when I'm standing in the sun and have the screen at 100% brightness. If this was the only issue, I could possibly deal with it by adjusting how I use the phone, but it's not the only issue.The biggest problem I have with this phone is my connection speed. I have made sure to adjust every setting the same that I can on the 30XL and Note 9. I even migrated all of my settings from that phone. I'm on Verizon network with what is a very good connection on the Note 9. I've tested my speed a dozen times in 6 different positions while connected to only mobile data and I'm averaging about 48 Mbps on the Note 9 and 0.02 Mbps on the 30XL! It's almost a non-existent connection. I'm swapping the sim card each time and checking the speed with the other phone as soon as I get the sim swapped while holding them in the exact same position. Both phones are 4G and say that in the bar. It has nothing to do with the sim and nothing to do with Verizon. All controllable parameters being equal, it's hard to believe that a phone 4 model years newer would run a data connection so much slower. It makes me believe there might be something wrong with this particular 30XL.The fingerprint reader is hit and miss on this phone. The speed of the phone switching from app to app is noticeably slower than the Note 9. Even typing on the phone feels a bit glitchy, like when I want to delete a couple sentences and hold down backspace/delete on my keyboard, it doesn't delete the letters and words smoothly, it doesn't feel like it can keep up and then all of a sudden it's deleted a bunch of words into the next sentence. I use the same keyboard on my Samsung, and this does not happen. I know this isn't a perfect comparison, it's what I have to work with. The perceived feel of a phone while it's processing is an important part of the overall experience.Maybe if I was able to splurge on one of TCL's higher end phones this wouldn't be an issue? I just didn't feel like I could get their higher end phone at the moment, and wanted to test out the company before potentially switching to them full time. I don't know if this phone is a lemon in more ways than just the mobile data speed?The phone does feel good in the hand, the screen size is good, and battery seems to last better than the Note 9 (which does still have it's original battery). If it wasn't for the phone feeling like it lags while processing, I'd consider getting the same replacement phone to see if the unusable mobile speeds are just a bad unit. As it is, I don't think I can try another 30XL, even for the great price.My significant other is wanting to switch from Samsung also. I was hoping I could recommend TCL, but right now I couldn't. I will have to return this phone. I'm not sure what direction to go from here, but we use our phones for so much online stuff nowadays that there's no way to keep a phone that doesn't do online stuff well, not to mention one that doesn't switch from app to app without a lag since everything is done using apps now.",I cannot recommend this phone right now.,2023-04-03,1.0

Makes me suspicious of all of the 5-star reviews for this product.------------------------------------------------------------I wanted to love these so bad.The design is very unique having such a large charging case. My plan was to keep these in my laptop bag so that not only would I always be sure to have earvuds with me for virtual meetings, but the wireless power bank would ensure I would always be able to keep my phone charged.Pros:Attractive design. Solid quality feel. Buds very securely held In via magnets. Extremely long battery life. Power bank is magnetic, so it can stick to the front of a desk drawer. Good sound quality.Cons:Very expensive, if the con list was shorter MAYBE it would be worth it. Poor connection quality, my first unit would frequently drop out the left bud. After exchanging for a new unit it stays connected but frequently stutters. I don't think they would stay connected if movi g around and exercising,  but it works OK for conference calls. The buds are not very ergonomic, they are almost a very generic ear bud shape that does not feel very secure and leaves my ears sore after 20-30 minutes I believe  these would frequently fall out of my ears during exercising.Overall, for the price, I could definitely not recommend these earbuds.",Niche product and overpriced - Updated,2022-03-24,1.0

And yes - I'm an experienced hardware guy so there's no apps running in the background consuming CPU clock ticks and plenty of memory.  It doesn't have NFC which is kind of a surprise since the technology is so cheap to implement - WHY?  The screen is sometimes hard to read in daylight.  It acts strange at times and performs poorly.  The good is that if you don't have applications running in the background that consume battery and CPU (think transmitting and processing - like active GPS apps) the battery life is really good.

I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.",An exceptional budget phone on par with bigger brands,2023-07-20,5.0,R3KY8STDM8WL9G,Jason,18.0,"First, I want to say I've only had a couple of days with this phone. However, with only a couple of days, this is my experience and what I have learned. I have Verizon. A normal 5G plan. Regardless what the posting says, this phone DOES WORK on Verizon networks. There is, however, a disclaimer here with all of my testing. I have a 5G SIM card for Verizon. When inserted, it does immediately pick up Verizon signals. All APN's check out fine and the same as my other Verizon Branded phones. Texts, multimedia pictures, and 5G data ALL WORK without issues. Calling, however, does NOT! I have tried changing settings and APN values with no resolve. I went as far as to go to an actual Verizon store (never do that lol) to get help setting it up. Verizon will try to claim it isn't compatible when I can say first hand it absolutely is! Now, here is the strange thing... I used another 4gLTE SIM card and EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECTLY! VoLTE lit up on the bars and I was also getting 5G speeds/signals as well. (For those whom aren't aware, there is essentially no difference in a 4gLTE and 5G SIM card. They both run on both bands. VoLTE is HD Calling which is necessary for Verizon networks now a days. But it does seem that this phone does not read the HD Calling (VoLTE) features on 5G cards. In my case, I was not able to get a new 4gLTE SIM card through Verizon as they only offer 5G SIM cards now. I do have my old 4gLTE SIM card and tried to have it activated but they said ""I would be going backwards and lose my current plan"". Again, there essentially is no difference in the cards. This is just Verizon being more of a pain in the a$$ than needed. I was using my 4gLTE SIM card on my current plan and using it with a 5G phone. No changes. I only changed to a 5G SIM card because I was looking to ""upgrade"" to a new SIM. My mistake clearly.So for those who want this phone on Verizon, YES it is absolutely possible! Just be sure you have a 4gLTE SIM card and everything works perfect. If you have a 5G SIM, everything works EXCEPT calling!As for the phone itself, again I only had a couple of days with it but I did test out many of its features. It was super fast. Zero lag or hangups. I did load it with all of my heavy usage apps and played with it quite a bit before I realized the calling wasn't working. I was using data and texting so I assumed everything was great. Until I tried making a call of course. Camera was pretty good with a beautiful clear picture. What I loved most about this phone was the extra custom programmable button on the side! I seriously wish other phone manufacturers would follow this lead. From quick launching an app to something as simple as enabling the flashlight without having to turn the phone on and finding the icon in the status bar. Amazing feature to have! No bloatware. Fit and feel were, in my opinion, what I would expect on a phone. It is a plastic case but overall weight and feel were great! Screen clarity was also very pleasant.All in all, I would absolutely recommend this phone given you're able to use it with your 4gLTE SIM card. You will absolutely still get your 5G speeds and such. Good luck!Update: I was contacted by a representative from Umidigi. She seemed to be extremely polite and fully admitted on their part of perhaps not having the correct radio bands built into the phone. Hopefully a future OTA Update can fix the issue. However, as with many sellers on here putting an image for more sales seems to be more important. I was offered ""full refund while keeping the device"" if I were to remove my real world review. First of all, the device was already returned so I wasn't getting anything ""free"". Secondly, I don't feel my review on this phone was horrible. I praised the phone for what it is. But I also feel it is just as important for others to be aware if they're also on the Verizon network. If you use other networks I'm sure it'll be perfect. Again, the phone and the built-in specs are amazing in my opinion. I just wish it would have worked on Verizon's VoLTE on a 5G SIM. Best of luck to this company and I'll look into them again in the future. As for now, I have went the Xiaomi Poco X5 Pro 5G and this phone is just absolutely incredible for its price point! And yes, everything works as it should. I'll have a review on that soon!",For those on Verizon network... READ THIS!,2023-08-14,1.0

The macro lense never takes quite crisp enough pictures. The main cameras zoom is grainy and pixelated. The main cameras video doesn't have good stabilization software2) trying to change media output is a pain compared to other phones, leaving you swiping the tray down twice, clicking a menu, clicking media output, and finally able to change it3) you can't change the shortcuts on the lock screen for some reason4) it is hard to disable the Google feed screen which I personally find useless. You have to disable the entire Google app. This was an issue on the N100 as well.5) after the last system update their ""red cable club"" app, is no longer in the app menu and cannot be uninstalled or disabled, and thus it is requesting updates when I will NEVER use it.6) after the same update, the Shelf (a secondary tray essentially) which was useful at first due to the pedometer and ability to add extra widgets like Wundergrounds weather, suddenly you can't use any custom widgets and the remaining options all suck, so it's an entire tray with one useful app... Aka, as good as useless.7) No MicroSD slot for the sole purpose of trying to force you to pay more for the next level sub-model. This is becoming a common practice, but it remains a BS one. It would be like a new TV not coming with any inputs, to try and force you to buy the higher model that has a built in Xbox console. You upgrade and get the Xbox and streaming apps, but you better hope you never want a blu-ray player or PS2. In this case it makes it a complete pain in the ass to transfer videos and photos or to clean them up on a larger screen, as the cable connection on phones has always been clunky compared to swapping a MicroSD.1+ OxygenOS is a love hate thing.

This phone does not have a flagship camera, the main camera zoom is blurry, the stabilization software is poor, there is no dual sim card slot. And worst of all, NO ALERT SLIDERS! That was the feature that made OP phones stand out from the rest.I know I could have avoided some of these issues if I had read the descriptions before buying, but I never expected OP to lower their standards so much in their recent phones.

I then signed up for a TracFone plan. I purchased the unlimited talk and text, and 2 GB plan. The reason I went with TracFone is because they have rollover minutes. My typical use of data is 1 GB per month. Therefore I thought I would be rolling over 1 GB each month. I just paid for my February plan on the 28th, so I should have 2 GB and whatever's left for rollover. I currently have .69 rollover GB  and zero new GB. At the bare minimum, I should have 2 GB of new data. And maybe 4 GB of rollover.I received a message that my phone had been unlocked, or was available to be unlocked, after 60 days of having my phone. I don't know if it's unlocked or not. I'm ready to move my phone to a different plan so I can get what I pay for, but the customer service is atrocious for TracFone.I first tried chatting online. I was number 86 in the queue, I waited. The person answered my question that I had .69 GB of data. I asked another question, and he was gone.So I called customer service and waited 25 minutes, the girl came on the phone and I asked her if she could first tell me when did I start my service with tracfone. She informed me she could not give me that information. I was confused! I asked her why she can't she said it's a policy. I said how then am I supposed to know if I have the right amount of rollover minutes. And she said it's a policy I can't tell you. I said well I have another question... And she cut me off.The phone rang, and it rang two rings I couldn't answer it quick enough and it was dead. My guess was that was them calling me back.I kept trying to call them back but it would get answered and then cut off, right away. No human no automated voice. I waited 40 minutes, and then I called again. This time the call went through, I waited 18 minutes. I got a guy named Bill on the phone, he told me you couldn't help me cuz his computer was down. I called again. I got a very helpful lady who told me that my balance was .69 GB. I explained to her that I just purchased 2 GB on February 28th and it's not showing in my system. She came back and was in the middle of answering me and we got cut off. I called back after waiting a long period of time I talked to another person, the system was down and he couldn't help me.I then did a chat through the app. That guy was pretty helpful... But then he got stuck because his system went down.I'm moving my service.... Don't get TracFone! Check out other reviews before you decide. You'll see I'm not the only one having troubles with the rollover minutes. Problem is I didn't read the reviews before I started my adventure with TracFone.Good luck.",Buyer beware,2023-03-05,1.0

I'd rather have an Umidigi than a $1200 flagship phone.  Look at it this way, if you lose it, or break it, or it gets stolen, or it breaks out of warranty, you're out $100-300 bucks depending on the model you bought.  I hate investing such a large sum of money in an item that can easily be stolen, lost or quit working.  I have the money to do so, but I'd rather invest that money or spend it elsewhere.  The one problem with this phone is it's WEIGHT!  Most likely due to the battery size.  I'd rather have the battery last less and have a lighter phone than have such a heavy phone with a long lasting battery.  SOme people may like the trade-off.  The phone is built superior to flagship $1200+ phones.  Durable, drop proof, waterproof.  What more can you ask for.  I HATE CASES, due to my OCD; stuff and dirt and skin oils get in crevices and under the case and I freak out!  Buying a durable IP68/69 miltiary-grade phone such as the Bison eliminates the need for a case.  I'm still afraid to drop the phone because it's so heavy!  But it could handle it.  I bought this phone on sale for $89.99 after the $20.00 coupon.  I could not complain!  If it lasts 6 months it's worth the money spent.  Absolutely AMAZING phone.

Deeply disappointed.,0.0,RE4ER1P5QMX1S,Realm of Nova,19.0,"As a longtime user of Pixel phones, I can't help but keep coming back to them even when I try a different phone, except this time.While the Pixel 7 continues to be one of the best value options on the market, my Pixel arrived with a faint but noticeable screen defect in which there were three shadow-like gray areas in the top, middle, and bottom portions of the screen that were very noticeable on bright backgrounds. This annoyed me when scrolling through apps or webpages and seeing text fade through these ""gray zones"" that I couldn't make go away- and this was from a brand new unit that I only had for a few days. Aside from my screen defect, the Pixel 7 was still a great phone.When it comes to the software experience, the clean Android experience is still one of the best that you can get, in addition to also being the first to get new Android updates as they roll out. The color themes that you can choose based on your wallpaper adds another level to customization, and you can even apply these colors to some app icons as well. The software is smooth, and I haven't had any of the software bugs that some others have had. However, what really makes the Pixel experience great are some of the features you can't get on other Android phones such as Google's ""screen call"", ""hold for me"", photo unblur, and magic erase options. My favorite of these is definitely screen call, as when enabled you can have the Pixel automatically answer the call for you and give you a transcript based on the call to let you know whether you should pick up or not in case it is spam. I get a lot of Spam calls personally, so this has saved me the hassle of having to take a lot of unnecessary calls. When it comes to the photo modes, the magic eraser works great when there isn't too much going on, but the photo unblur ability isn't that great. I found that even photos that are only slightly blurred sometimes just get added sharpness from this mode, but without actually unblurring the parts of the photo I needed. My overall favorite part of the default android experience though, is the Google toolbar on the bottom of your homepage. While on the Pixel this bar is not removable, I found it to be the best implementation out of any android phone as it not only allows you to search Google whenever you need, but it also searches your device for apps, videos, and more that might be stored on it. Think of it as an all-in-one search that not only searches the web, but searches your device as well as giving you recommendations based on your recently used apps.Aside from software, the main reason why I have always used Pixel phones is the camera. While the Pixel 7 does have some improvements to the larger sensor, all of the magic still happens on the software processing side. Even photos that may not look like they will be good before pressing the shutter, will look like a professional photo as soon as it is captured and finished processing. This is what the Pixel does best. No matter what phone I use, whether Android-wise or iPhone, the photos produced by the Pixel series are still the best I've ever seen and used. Photos just pop with a well balanced blend of saturation, color, lighting, and sharpness that looks natural to real life. Selfies are the same as well. Despite the front selfie camera being a lower megapixel camera compared to the rear sensor, it still produces great photos and the portrait mode is one of the best on a smartphone. However, while the Pixel 7 captures great photos, it still needs some work on the video side. Videos are an improvement over previous generations, but videos still need a lot of light to look good. When in a well-lit room or outside on a sunny day, the videos are vivid, detailed, clear, and sharp, but as soon as the lights start to dim, the videos will return to a noisy mess. For videos, the iPhone still remains supreme, in my opinion, but the next gen Pixel just might close the gap on the video side.When it comes to battery life, it is a bit of a mixed bag. The Pixel 7 had very mediocre battery life in the first day or two that I had it, with it not lasting more than 4-5 hours on a full charge for me. However, by day 3, the battery life nearly doubled as the adaptive battery feature noticed the apps I was using and optimized itself for a better experience. The phone charges at an average rate and still doesn't charge very fast over wired or wireless chargers, but it is still good enough to fully charge it in a bit over an hour when plugged in directly.When it comes to performance, the Tensor 2 is a powerhouse, but it still doesn't even come close to the newer Snapdragon Flagship chips from the last couple of years. Games can still be a bit stuttery and laggy at times, and you may have to lower some settings for a smooth experience. However, it is still a very capable chip and I would still say it is 2nd best after the Snapdragon.The display is something that is still a mixed bag as although I received a defective unit with my ""gray zones'', the OLED panel used on the non-Pro variants still continues to be much lower quality than the LTPO panels used on the Pro version. While the refresh rate can still go up to 90Hz and is a significant improvement over 60Hz panels, my primary complaint is actually about the fact that the brightness is significantly lower even at max levels and has way more noticeable color shifting when tilting the phone screen to the sides. While it is an OLED panel that still delivers vibrant colors and rich blacks, I just wish it had at least a 1st gen LTPO panel or a higher quality AMOLED than what is being used. While these complaints may seem unwarranted because my display was defective, this was an issue with the Pixel 6 as well when it came to using a lower quality panel compared to the Pro. As someone who has also used the A-series of Pixel phones, the displays on those budget options are nearly identical in quality to the Pixel 7, just with a faster refresh rate on 7 itself.Overall, while the phone itself is still the best value for the money, I was disappointed that my brand new unit had such a big flaw with the display. I've never had this issue with Pixel phones before and it really impacted my opinion of Google's quality for the time being. Aside from that, I still highly recommend this phone to those who want a nearly full flagship phone experience but without spending more than is needed. In terms of photos and software, it is the best there is, but for gaming, productivity, and videos, it still needs some improvements.",Pixel Phones are Still King but Mine Had Flaws,2023-09-10,4.0,R1OH3858AUS7SZ,TJ,109.0,"Update 2/19/23. So last update Amazon graciously gave me a very fair partial refund even though it was outside the 2 month window. (I owned the phone for 4 mos and 2 days) And I have sent the pixel 7 back to them. Google customer service continues to be abysmal. Overall phone was not better than pixel 2 for me, but aside from all my issues still a decent value and I still like Pixel phones better than the competition. Read on if you desire to see my trials and tribulations with the Pixel 7. So I finally got around to working through the warranty process (for cracked rear camera lens) with Google and was put in touch with a local ubreakit/wefixit shop who promptly told me it wasn't covered(incidental damage). I was quoted $249 to repair. I declined and contacted Amazon again who proceeded to offer me a very fair partial refund which I accepted and sent the phone back. I am back to using my pixel 2 which still works better for me, while I regroup and figure out what is next. Thanks Amazon you are absolutely fantastic you didn't have to make this right and you did, so thanks,  and if you make a smartphone I would love to buy it. Google customer service your lucky I still like the pixel because you are absolutely atrocious to work with.Update 1/14/23 on the plus side it appears that the USB c port issues were software related, it stopped having issues after the last update. So that is a win.I contacted Amazon about the broken camera lens it appears this is a common issue on Pixel 7s due to a manufacturing error in producing the glass. Apparently they shatter due to internal stress. Amazon told me that they couldn't help me because it was outside the 2 month return window. But it has a one year warranty by Google. I reached out to Google for the warranty claim and I received an email from a company lawyer saying if I was sueing them about the issue they have received my information and would email me back. I haven't heard anything since. I imagine I will have to contact them again. But only the wide angle camera is affected and I don't use that. So overall I am actually pretty happy with this phone. And now that the USB c port works again it does everything I need. I hear pixel 8 is smaller so will see when that one comes out. Adding a star because everything I care about works now. Google customer service sucks, but still wouldn't pay $1200 for a comparable iphone or Samsung.Update 12/3/22I have started having issues with the USB C port it doesn't grab the cable tightly and causes issues with Android auto and often if I attempt to charge by cable it will appear to be charging and than won't. I have cleaned it out, but no obvious debris. I bought this first day available and received it October 17, so not quite two months. I have worked around this using a wireless charger but still data xfer and android auto are a problem.Additionally I bought and use a Spigen case and screen protector, but I pulled it out of my pocket and found the glass shattered above the camera lens.  I am guessing that I leaned against something with it in my pocket but I didn't drop it or violate it in an obvious manner.  I definitely need a phone that I can carry in my pocket and that is adequately protected with a case and screen protector although a nice phone maybe not durable enough for me. Never had an issue with pixel 2 on the durability front.Fortunately both the camera and phone still work but definitely not tracking for another four year performance.Original review -I have been using this phone for a little over a month. I upgraded from a pixel 2.Pros- Good battery life, updates and is supported for the next 3 years.Cons-Significantly larger than pixel 2, fingerprint scanner is almost unusable.There is a lot of reviews on the cameras and how great they are, I'm sure they are excellent for my uses the pixel 2 was more than adequate and this one is also more than adequate.The fingerprint reader is a problem, the pixel 2 worked almost flawlessly for the 4 years I used it every day. The pixel 7 might work 2 out of 10 times maybe 1 out of ten, it is so inconsistent that I really can't use it for biometric authentication. I have read the fixes and troubleshooting, none of it really works, I'm not going to carry a fingerprint wetter around with me.I think a lot of the things that drove me to upgrade, were do to Google refusing to support the Pixel 2 it received its last update at the end of 2020 and it started a few months ago to experience buggy performance with connectivity and the GPS, with no real fixes due to being two revs behind on Android.For me the fingerprint scanner and size combined with a brand new pixel 2, makes it a better phone than the pixel 7. Unfortunately I can't go back in time and can only hope that in four years pixel 12 is smaller and has a functional fingerprint scanner.The 7 is a good phone and at $500 it is an excellent value. They certainly have upgraded the cameras and the tensor system works well. I certainly am glad I went this route over the other options.I just think there is a point where some of the driving features, cameras, operating systems, weird swipe modes etc are really not noticeably better and drive up cost and size and lead to removal of things I would like such as a stand alone fingerprint scanner and 3.5 mm jack. Hope Google reads this","Amazon is excellent, Google customer service not so much.",2022-11-16,3.0

As they say, ""You get what you pay for,"" and this phone perfectly embodies that sentiment. If you're looking for a budget-friendly device that covers the basics, the A03 might be an option to consider. However, be prepared to deal with its frustratingly sluggish performance.Pros:✅ Budget-Friendly: One of the most appealing aspects of the Samsung A03 is undoubtedly its price. It's a wallet-friendly option for those who need a smartphone but don't want to break the bank.✅ Decent Display: The display is adequate for everyday tasks such as checking emails, browsing social media, and watching videos. The colors are decent, and the screen size is comfortable.Cons:❌ Sluggish Performance: The most significant drawback of the A03 is its painfully slow performance. Apps take forever to open, switching between tasks is a test of patience, and even simple actions like typing can lead to frustrating delays. This sluggishness significantly hampers the overall user experience.❌ Limited Storage: The internal storage on the A03 is quite limited, leaving you with minimal space for apps, photos, and other files. You'll likely find yourself constantly juggling storage to make room for new content.❌ Mediocre Camera: While I didn't expect flagship-level camera quality from a budget phone, the A03's camera still falls short. Photos lack detail and tend to look washed out, especially in low-light conditions.❌ Outdated Software: The A03 comes with an older version of Samsung's software, and updates are infrequent. This not only means missing out on the latest features but also leaves you vulnerable to security risks.Overall Impression:The Samsung A03 is a prime example of the trade-off between price and performance. If you're on a tight budget and need a device for the bare minimum tasks like calls, texts, and occasional browsing, the A03 might serve its purpose. However, if you're looking for a smoother experience, even for basic tasks, I'd recommend saving up a bit more for a more capable phone. The sluggishness and limited features of the A03 can quickly become frustrating, overshadowing its affordable price point. Consider your priorities carefully before making a decision.",Affordable but Slow,2023-08-09,3.0

It's very annoying because you have apps all over your screen that you have to organized yourself.Another cons of this phone is the placement of the power button. It's way too low for one hand use. It should be where the ""volume - "" button is. I accidentally press the volume button quite often when trying to press the power button. It will need some getting used to for some people.When using this phone, it feel very basic. There are no features that stand out at all except maybe for the camera which is probably the phone main selling point. This phone is like the jack of all trade of low end phone.In the description, it stated that the 128gb version can be use on cdma network. I do not use cdma network, but it does work on my tmobile network. I can make and receive calls. I get about 500mbs-900mbs download speed when downloading apps.The specs that this phone comes with, would have cost $50 more on other phone. Umidigi made budget phones with good specs at a much lower price than other manufacturer but they are known not to update security patch of the phone. This can be a major reason why some people choose other phone over others.If you need a phone that can do a bit of everything, then this phone is decent for you. If security is a concern for you, then this phone might not be for you.Update:Tested the phone playing games, battery lasted about 4-5 hours. If you are using the phone mainly for surfing the web or watching youtube, it probably last a little longer. The games and os is no longer as laggy. Fingerprint reader is very responsive. It is a huge improvement over previous model fingerprint reader because it recognized my finger print even when it's wet. It's a good phone for the price.",Decent Budget Phone,2020-07-31,5.0,R3K1KEMULQPQED,DonValdino,7.0,"This review is for the Umidigi F3 pictured. So I had this phone for a while now. The only reason I decided to buy a new phone was because my old phone, LG V40 ThinQ, would not charge. The prongs in the charging port got screwed up. So I went ahead and bought this phone just for the time being, I just needed a phone. Ok, now let's get right to it. Battery life I find to be average at best, I'm not a heavy phone user either. Supposed to have a 5150mah battery, well my LG has a 3200mah and they last the same, weird. Oh, and after buying this phone i found out about a nest feature my LG has, wireless charging 😑 so yes, it can charge now 🤦🏽‍♂️. Alright so back to the Umidigi, camera, again, no wow factor here either, the image of the Umidigi box was taken with the phone, so that should give you and idea. This I will say, the macro camera is in fact really good, but the main ""Sony"" camera and the other are average at best. Sound, average but the functions are annoying, let me explain. So if you are on a call and switch over to loudspeaker, if the volume is not all the way up, the call goes in and out, like you'll hear the voice go up and down in volume, it stays consistent only if the volume is at max and stays there. Brightness feature, is good, but it stays rather bright in the dark, like it does not know to turn brightness all the way down, you have to set it to manual and lower it yourself. Storage is amazing, 128gb of rom is great. 8gb of ram I don't believe, my LG has 6gb of ram and it's waaayyyy smoother than this phone that supposed to have 8gb of ram. When playing CODm it glitches, not for long periods of time, maybe a second, but it does glitch, just freezes on you and you get all the lines going across the screen. Connectivity, works flawlessly on my T-Mobile, no issues there, calls connect with ease, and like I mentioned before, so as long as the volume is at max, you can hear just fine. Social media, no issues there, internet browsing no issues there either. YouTube, no issues there, streaming music no issues there al well as streaming movies, no issues there either. Now to sum it all up, if you are like I was, in need of a phone asap for the time being, then this phone will be just fine. If you are looking for a budget phone with flagship phone performance, you are looking in the wrong place. This phone came out in 2022, my LG came out in 2018. This phone was $160 my LG $700 when it just came out in 2018. Although my Umidigi is recent, you cannot compare these two phones. The price speaks for itself. The LG to date still performs as a $700 dollar phone. So when you look at it from that point of view, bang for the buck, the Umidigi F3 performs as a $160 phone, don't expect anything more. All the features are sales pitch, that's why you buy the phone, you see the specs then see the price and go wow! And you buy it, then a few months go by, and the phone just sits there because it's not as great as you expected. At best, this phone is a temporary phone, something to hold you down until you can get something better. Overall i give this phone 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Just think of the price,2023-04-02,3.0

It has a large 6.52-inch IPS display, a 50MP main camera, a 5150mAh battery, and runs on Android 12. It also comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 256GB with a microSD card. The phone is powered by the Unisoc Tiger T610 octa-core processor, which delivers decent performance and efficiency.  All setup and app operations were performed smoothly and without and issues.  I experienced no crashes or other negative performance issues throughout my time using this device.ProsThe Umidigi G1 Max has a sleek and stylish design, with a right-angle frame and a glossy back. It comes in two colors: Galaxy Blue and Starry Black. I received the Galaxy Blue and found this finish to be really quality and not a fingerprint magnet.  Also Super Bonus, the device was delivered with a case which is awesome!The phone has a large and immersive display, with a 20:9 aspect ratio and a waterdrop notch. The screen has a resolution of 720 x 1600 pixels, which is adequate for watching videos and browsing the web.The phone has a powerful 50MP main camera, which can capture detailed and vivid photos in various scenarios. It also has a 2MP depth camera for portrait mode, and an 8MP selfie camera. The phone supports night mode, HDR, panorama, and 1080p video recording. I had no issues watching videos or editing photos all were done with speed and ease.The phone has a massive 5150mAh battery, which can last for more than a day of moderate use. It also supports fast charging with a 10W charger included in the box. - I never had an issue with the battery running out before a full day of use which I cannot say the same for other devices I have used lately.The phone runs on Android 12, which offers enhanced privacy features, dynamic personalization, and faster app startup. The phone also has minimal bloatware and offers a smooth user experience.The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and face unlock, which are fast and convenient to use. It also has other sensors such as accelerometer, proximity, and compass.The phone supports global bands, dual SIM, dual standby, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BDS, and USB Type-C. It does not have NFC though.ConsThe Umidigi G1 Max has a low screen resolution compared to other phones in its price range. It also has thick bezels around the display, which reduce the screen-to-body ratio.The phone does not have a dedicated microSD slot, but uses a hybrid SIM slot instead. This means that users have to choose between dual SIM or extra storage.The phone does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, which may disappoint some users who prefer wired headphones. It also does not have stereo speakers or Dolby Atmos support.ConclusionThe Umidigi G1 Max is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers some impressive specs for its price. It has a large display, a powerful camera, a huge battery, and Android 12. It also has ample RAM and storage space, and supports global bands. All around a great device that checks in much higher performance wise than the low price tag would otherwise indicate!!",Fantastic Budget Option Android That Punches Above It's Weight Class With Features,2023-05-25,5.0,R3KDM6LHGWP8EC,Ron Novak,9.0,"See edits belowI bought the G 1 Max to replace another old phone. Had already bought an UMIDGI Bison 2 Pro, WHICH WORKS WITH VERIZON. I checked the specs on the G 1 Max, looked the same as the Bison. When I got it, I checked out the G 1 AND IT DOESN'T WORK (voice and text) WITH VERIZON..... Well, why? After an hour talking to a Verizon Tech Person, I think I know. The write-up says it doesn't work with CDMA providers like Verizon, but Verizon has discontinued CDMA. So that is meaningless. They use 4 G LTE now... This phone uses 4 G LTE, so it must work.... NOT! Verizon uses 4 G LTE with VOLTE, Voice Over LTE..... So to work with Verizon the device has to have VOLTE.. The Bison 2 Pro has it (just try to find it in the specs!), and it's good with Verizon, the G 1 Max doesn't and it doesn't work....... Connects, but no texts or voice.....This is too bad, since the G 1Max is a really nice phone. I would like to find one like it that works with Verizon. And it helps that it's half the price of the Bison 2 Pro. I'm on my second Bison, the screen on the first went black and white and started flashing on and off.... We'll see how the second holds up.Guess I'll have to do more research on the pathetic UMIDGI website to find all their 4 G, VOLTE devices....... Happy hunting!EDIT 1Looking at the glitzy UMIDIGI website dazzles the eye but doesn’t tell you much, like all sales pitches. HOWEVER, looking at the specs for a similar device to the G1 MAX, the C1 MAX, (they are lumped together) it look as if the C1 does support VOLTE. That said, the specs of the two devices are lumped together, but the G1 does not have VOLTE. So, I am going to order the C1 MAX and see if it actually works on Verizon. I commented to the techs at UMIDIGI that they ought to segregate the devices by generation and have a category for VOLTE since it seems to be the deciding factor in whether a device works with Verizon. Don’t hold your breath! Stay tuned for the next edit!Edit 2Neither the C1 nor the G1 is likely to work with Verizon. With a lot of research and an hour with a Verizon “technician”, I have come to the conclusion that in order for a cellphone to work with Verizon, two things are necessary; First, the phone has to use VOLTE, and Second, it has to use bands 2, 4, AND 13! (This is for 4G only) Neither the C1 nor the G1 has band 13, and they probably won’t work. I checked the specs of 11 Umidgi phones and bought an A11 to check this hypothesis out. It has both VOLTE and bands 2, 4, and 13. AND IT WORKS FINE WITH VERIZON!!!!! And it is priced at ~$109!!!!!! So check the specs and don’t get stuck……..Edit 3I have upgraded my rating to 3 stars since I think that the G1 Max is a fine phone, it just doesn't work with Verizon....... The experience I had with it otherwise (GPS, cruising the internet, etc) was a good one. Like I indicated, I wish the phone worked with Verizon! The build quality is good and it is a bargain!","DOES NOT WORK WITH VERIZON, PERIOD!!!!!! See edit",2023-03-02,3.0

I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.",An exceptional budget phone on par with bigger brands,2023-07-20,5.0,R3KY8STDM8WL9G,Jason,18.0,"First, I want to say I've only had a couple of days with this phone. However, with only a couple of days, this is my experience and what I have learned. I have Verizon. A normal 5G plan. Regardless what the posting says, this phone DOES WORK on Verizon networks. There is, however, a disclaimer here with all of my testing. I have a 5G SIM card for Verizon. When inserted, it does immediately pick up Verizon signals. All APN's check out fine and the same as my other Verizon Branded phones. Texts, multimedia pictures, and 5G data ALL WORK without issues. Calling, however, does NOT! I have tried changing settings and APN values with no resolve. I went as far as to go to an actual Verizon store (never do that lol) to get help setting it up. Verizon will try to claim it isn't compatible when I can say first hand it absolutely is! Now, here is the strange thing... I used another 4gLTE SIM card and EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECTLY! VoLTE lit up on the bars and I was also getting 5G speeds/signals as well. (For those whom aren't aware, there is essentially no difference in a 4gLTE and 5G SIM card. They both run on both bands. VoLTE is HD Calling which is necessary for Verizon networks now a days. But it does seem that this phone does not read the HD Calling (VoLTE) features on 5G cards. In my case, I was not able to get a new 4gLTE SIM card through Verizon as they only offer 5G SIM cards now. I do have my old 4gLTE SIM card and tried to have it activated but they said ""I would be going backwards and lose my current plan"". Again, there essentially is no difference in the cards. This is just Verizon being more of a pain in the a$$ than needed. I was using my 4gLTE SIM card on my current plan and using it with a 5G phone. No changes. I only changed to a 5G SIM card because I was looking to ""upgrade"" to a new SIM. My mistake clearly.So for those who want this phone on Verizon, YES it is absolutely possible! Just be sure you have a 4gLTE SIM card and everything works perfect. If you have a 5G SIM, everything works EXCEPT calling!As for the phone itself, again I only had a couple of days with it but I did test out many of its features. It was super fast. Zero lag or hangups. I did load it with all of my heavy usage apps and played with it quite a bit before I realized the calling wasn't working. I was using data and texting so I assumed everything was great. Until I tried making a call of course. Camera was pretty good with a beautiful clear picture. What I loved most about this phone was the extra custom programmable button on the side! I seriously wish other phone manufacturers would follow this lead. From quick launching an app to something as simple as enabling the flashlight without having to turn the phone on and finding the icon in the status bar. Amazing feature to have! No bloatware. Fit and feel were, in my opinion, what I would expect on a phone. It is a plastic case but overall weight and feel were great! Screen clarity was also very pleasant.All in all, I would absolutely recommend this phone given you're able to use it with your 4gLTE SIM card. You will absolutely still get your 5G speeds and such. Good luck!Update: I was contacted by a representative from Umidigi. She seemed to be extremely polite and fully admitted on their part of perhaps not having the correct radio bands built into the phone. Hopefully a future OTA Update can fix the issue. However, as with many sellers on here putting an image for more sales seems to be more important. I was offered ""full refund while keeping the device"" if I were to remove my real world review. First of all, the device was already returned so I wasn't getting anything ""free"". Secondly, I don't feel my review on this phone was horrible. I praised the phone for what it is. But I also feel it is just as important for others to be aware if they're also on the Verizon network. If you use other networks I'm sure it'll be perfect. Again, the phone and the built-in specs are amazing in my opinion. I just wish it would have worked on Verizon's VoLTE on a 5G SIM. Best of luck to this company and I'll look into them again in the future. As for now, I have went the Xiaomi Poco X5 Pro 5G and this phone is just absolutely incredible for its price point! And yes, everything works as it should. I'll have a review on that soon!",For those on Verizon network... READ THIS!,2023-08-14,1.0

No comment on service since I don’t use it.  Haven’t used camera.  Probably 4* for what I needed it for but as a primary phone I expect it would get bloated quickly and half the storage is already used with installed stuff.  But it was only $50!",Adequate for what I needed.,2023-07-01,3.0

It's metal body gives me a very premium feeling that I normally could only expect on $1000 phones like the iphone pro max or samsung s series. What I like the most is that we get all the accessories that we can't normally see on the high end phones, like dual sim support and the micro sd card support. Honestly getting the micro sd card slot on a high quality phone is pretty much the single dominate factor that led to my purchase decision. The phone also comes with other nice features like night vision camera, fm radio, high power flash light, etc, which are all nice pluses, but won't make me so excited about. However in my opinion, the only regret about the phone is that it didn't comes with a 3.5mm audio jack, which are normally found on other doogee phones like s61 or s51. I am not sure what caused the designer of the phone to remove the audio jack, but it's certainly a big loss for a customer who still love to use wired headphones like me. And I just assume there should be enough space on the phone to accommodate such an audio jack considering the size of the phone. I certainly hope they could consider to adopt the jack in the future version of the phone.

The phone has issues with the power button, it delays starting up after is sleeps, and has trouble switching quickly between apps, and occasionally doesn't wake up at all and needs a forced restart. Don't get me wrong, it works, it just requires a lot of patience. It's also bigger and heavier that you'd expect (but that's probably rugged phones in general).

Trying to locate a compatible charging cord for at home, I did, but was displayed that it was “slow charging” and to “use the proper charger”. 🫤  I felt anxious to see it work, there not being many compatible phones for Tello service with a T-Mobile connection.  As soon as installing my Sim card given by Tello, it displayed T-Mobile on the screen, so I then I went thru settings and made test calls / texts, and was working.ANYWAY…after trying the phone, there are some features that I am liking, so I suppose it is okay, but I am unhappy to have not had the charger included (and as others have stated, it NOT being a “type C” as described in the product information, but rather a Micro USB), not provided, AND feel I  should be refunded something since apparently it being refurbished, which I had contacted the seller and Amazon, regarding.*To add from product description:  “Product will come with a SIM removal tool, a charger and a charging cable”.  As mentioned, the charging cable was missing, AND the other items.  I had to order a separate charging cable, getting only a small amount credited by Amazon, and NOT from the seller who made NO effort to correct the error.  (It figures that this would occur with a phone I would want, since it works with chosen service).* The seller had said it “was up to Amazon”, though the seller was the one making the error.  I was told I would need to send back to get another phone sent, in order to be refunded.  The thing is, I did not want to fiddle with the Sim sent by Tello, in case it could get damaged, then would need THAT replaced, also.  After speaking to Amazon, was told that I could get a slight refund.  So, I unknowingly paid $108.41 for a refurb. phone sent by the seller, yet those being listed at $48.00.  This is the first time I have had an issue like this and not too happy. 😒So, the phone itself seems okay, I like that navigating is quick, the phone being smaller and more lightweight, the features being straightforward, and the overall look is fine.  I was initially overshadowed by the product-receiving issue, and was unsure about the phone.  After getting a proper charging cord, I saw that it charges more quickly, seems to last a bit for my needs.  The phone seems fine, I am just angry at the seller - LincolnWood or something, for the mishap.","It was received without a charger..phone seems not bad, review is overshadowed by sender error.",2023-05-28,3.0

I got the 128gb S21 FE model and I only paid $590 USD for the black version, despite really really wanting the white version, yet that one was priced at $699 USD. Would I pay $699 for it? Probably not, but everyone has a different budget for everything!When I received the phone, it came in its regular factory box which is very thin, like I was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case, but nope! They've cut down on everything that they send you. It came with the phone, a manual in a tiny box, a sim card tool behind that box, and I believe short type c cable, I already have a charging cable so I didn't pay any attention to it. Not that big of a deal really, it just worried me for a second haha.Now I'm someone who worries about storage, and this phone does NOT come with a micro SD card slot (unlike the S20 FE), however I've not had any problems with my storage yet, I still have roughly 61GB out of the 128GB to go. The system itself is 22.5GB which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine, and then I play a lot of games so my apps take around 39GB. I don't take many photos either so I only have around 1GB used, but if you are someone who loves to take photos, I recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over, as spending $70-$130+ for just 128GB of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500GB on a standalone drive. It is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone, also adds 2GB of ram to it, giving it a speed boost, but I'm about to go over some things about the phone's speed.As for game wise, I play Genshin Impact, Colorful Stage/Project Sekai, Stardew Valley, Pokemon GO, and Fallout Shelter, and this thing runs them all like a BEAST. I wouldn't recommend getting the extra 2GB of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it. Anyone who's ever played Genshin Impact knows how heavy the game is, and it can run it at max settings just fine, the only problem, is that it gets INCREDIBLY hot. So hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5-15 minutes. This could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around $20-30. I do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so I do play extremely comfortably in low-medium settings as it still looks great! However if you're looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games (since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game, causing lag), I'll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an Iphone or a Oneplus since they do that well.The camera is good for me! I take photos of my dog and that's it. It also has a 30x zoom which is crazy. The front camera is really good and I sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it's super funny haha. The fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector. Fun fact I found: you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it'll unlock! So you don't even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button. I was never a fan of 120hz screens and I still am not, but it looks super smooth when I have it turned on. The AMOLED screen was a huge game changer for me, it's beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors. I know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device, but I honestly haven't had any problems whatsoever. Now I do keep medium power saving mode on as I just don't see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you're not using it. It lasts about a day and a half. I work 9-5 and I come home with 70% battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently. Now I will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only, but I experienced that issue with my last phone so there's a massive chance that's just my mobile data provider (which is US Cellular). By the way, this phone is unlocked, so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use. I also think it supports 2 sim cards? I'm not too sure as I'm not someone who would ever have to use it, but if you are, then that's a plus.Overall this phone is absolutely amazing and I 11/10 recommend it :)",Love love love!

The only reason I'm writing this is to warn anyone thinking about getting this as a budget phone at some point in the future. The glue holding the back panel has loosened to the point where it is lifting off the phone. There is no bulging battery, as far as I can tell. The cheap glue that they used to put the S20 FE together is just not holding together anymore. They tout having software/security updates for however many years, but what good is that if the phone falls apart before you get to that point?To anyone reading this in the future: no, this phone isn't worth $499 (the price amazon has it as I'm writing this) new in 2023. The chip is still okay and it has that precious SD slot that phone manufacturers don't want to include nowadays so people buy the expensive, higher storage models. If you really, really want one to use as a budget phone, look for a refurbished one. I've found ones being sold for under $150. Who knows? Maybe the phone refurbishers used better glue to put the phone back together.I haven't decided which phone to get next. All I know is that it won't be a Samsung.Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It's been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here's the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic ""angry Amazon customer 1-star"" review, but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.","Great phone, marred by some pretty big issues.",2020-11-18,3.0

And even if you break it, Samsung is the Honda of phones. Parts are always cheap, readily available, and as such repairs are cheaper and easier to access.Looks good while doing all of the above.Cons:The fingerprint reader is abysmal. I'm coming from a Razer Phone 2 which read and recognized my fingerprints near instantaneously, and very reliably. Sometimes this thing just refuses to recognize my prints, or takes a good second or so to do anything about it.This camera is years behind what it was hyped up to be. On my RP2 I was running a Gcam mod and generally getting better results, ESPECIALLY in night mode. I was kind of gutted when I discovered how inferior this camera array is. Lots of noise on the wide angle, tons of focus hunting regardless of which lens you're using, just generally primitive by today's standards. Is it a hardware issue or a software issue? No idea, but it's unacceptable either way. Do NOT buy this phone for the cameras. Many cameras from a few years ago are better, especially with Gcam.The display, while beautiful, has pretty terrible viewing angles. Yet another problem I thought we left back in 2015.RAM is silly low, even by flagship standards from 2-3 years ago.Meh:Samsung is still lagging behind stock android in many ways. There are a lot of redundant and pointless apps/""features"" that are clearly just Samsung trying to trick you into giving THEM your data, rather than Google; and doing it poorly. Customization is somehow better and worse than ROMs which are closer to stock. Sammy put a few decent features in here for customizing, but not really anything you couldn't have gotten from a 3rd party. The launcher is terrible and restricting, but easy to replace. I personally use Microsoft Launcher with a bunch of 3rd party widgets, icon packs, etc.Conclusion:At the end of the day, this is a matter of price. When this phone was released for around $1k, it was insanely overpriced and not at all worth it. However, I snagged it on Prime Day for $699. At that price, I feel like it BARELY scapes past acceptable. $100 more than that and I would have returned it and waited to see what comes out later this year from other mfgs. The s21 line is bizarre to me. It blends top of the line features and tech with relatively archaic features and tech. I would not call this a flagship series, except in that Samsung does not have a higher-tiered line. This could have been much more polished, and it's sad they cut corners and had some critical oversights. But again, if you can get this for almost half of what it cost at launch retail, it's worth it. Don't expect bleeding edge performance across the board, and you should be satisfied.",Give and take.,2021-07-13,5.0,R1NUWPES21TOH,YnotMe,10.0,"It's a crying shame my carrier is forcing me to ""upgrade"".

I guess it is smooth and fast out of the box, but aren't they all, flagships that is. Now for what I don't like.

I'll miss not having sd card slot. I'd love a removable battery, but I know I won't see on here.

This is true of the A15, as it has been with the F1,  Bison, & Bison Pro I previously purchased.It is important to note, however, that often these phones perform at levels less than you would expect given the tech spec sheet they arrive with.Primarily, this will be most evident to end-users  when using the camera on their device. If you compare their camera performance to other premium brands such as Apple, Samsung, or Sony you will find that despite the high megapixel count the photos you take will lack the software optimizations that their competitors include - you may get all the pixels of the 64MP photo, but the clarity, focus, and color levels often do not match the quality that even lower megapixel cameras of premium brand phones achieve.Operating in conditions like low light or using features such as macro mode may make those differences more prominent and pronounced. This has improved over time with their handsets, but users should be aware that this difference in photo quality exists and will be difficult to overcome even for power or pro-level camera users.Another area in which you may find that performance seems to deviate from the stated specifications is in speed of multi-tasking and graphical processing capabilities.I have done a side by side speed check of similar operations with this handset vs. OnePlus 8 Pro 5G and despite the 12GB of RAM on that handset being 25% less powerful compared to the A15 it was considerably and consistently slower than the OnePlus.This is more an anecdotal, unscientific comparison, but if one benchmarks this via Antutu or other performance benchmarking apps, I would expect the results would be consistent with my observations.The build quality of the A15 is acceptable but not exceptional. When the handset has been active and is warmed up, you can put moderate pressure on the screen lens for a couple seconds and feel a small amount of malleability and compression occur, meaning it has glass that is not of a higher mohs hardness you would expect from a similar competitor offering, and I have found their screens more easily broken than other Gorilla Glass lenses and LCD's.A word of caution regarding the warranty and build quality of Umidigi products. Of the 4 I have received, one had a broken microphone out of the box that even failed their factory QC feature check. Despite months of back and forth with Umidigi, they refused to offer to take it back to repair or send me a replacement. They ghosted me after 2 months of consistent messaging on eBay, where I purchased it from their official account. After doing some research, this was not a unique experience and many forums will tell you that as a general rule, except for the immediate return grace period there is no recourse for any product failure or defect.OS Updates are seldom for these phones and I would not expect them to be updated past the initial Android version. Security updates are relatively non-existent.This does not bother me, but temper your expectations if you are hoping for long-lasting device support.All that is not to say that I haven't been happy with their product for the price, when it worked out of the box. Despite the lackluster camera features, their phones have been a good value for the price and performance has been acceptable if not impressive for the budget.One very welcome highlight of these phones is the 5,000+ mAh batteries that they contain. Though charging on previous devices has not been extremely fast, they do last an impressive length of time and after a year on 2 of them with moderate to heavy use they discharged pretty slowly. This has been one of my favorite qualities in these phones and I have nothing but praise for Umidigi in this regard. Comparably, OnePlus and Samsung handsets I have owned have fared considerably worse on battery life past the 1 year mark, although charging them is slightly faster.I also would point out that their speaker quality hasn't left much to be desired and is better than other budget handsets in the same price range.Their screen brightness is somewhat lower at maximum setting than other phones and less visible in direct sunlight, but this has not been a deal breaker in my experience. You will find it you like a brighter screen experience that anything less than 80%+ is essentially useless, but this doesn't seem to be a huge drain on the battery life, which may in and of itself be an indicator of the brightness level range generally.The fingerprint readers have been placed intuitively on their handsets and work modestly well, but they pale in comparison to Apple, Samsung, and OnePlus. I get about 25% success rate when using them, and often default to using the alternative unlock method after multiple attempts.In summary, there are drawbacks to purchasing budget phones in terms of performance and quality, but Umidigi has stuck a fairly impressive value-for-money compromise and if the unit you receive works and you donr require after-purchase support you'll likely feel good about your pirchaae if you have reasonable expectations, but if those conditions are not met, you will have wasted your money and no amount of time with their customer service support will change that.3J9H+FJ Brooklyn Park, MNSo put the phone through an extensive evaluation during the return period and do not hesitate to return it if it isn't what you wanted.If you don't return it, you'll likely feel like you've gotten a good deal of phone for not a great deal of money.Oh, and it comes with a case and screen protector and a very solid AC charger and cable in a very attractive box. Those are all very welcome additions at this price and all are very satisfactory quality and hold up quite well in my experience.",It's a gamble to get a good-to-great budget phone for the price - but there are drawbacks,2023-10-08,4.0,R1WFD83LUM1XPW,Yapanese,2.0,Not compatible with verizon,Check compatibalitity,2023-09-26,3.0

It would have meant having to transfer everything back to old phone while waiting for a replacement and then transferring everything again to replacement phone.  Just very disappointed that this happened. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. Hopefully I won't have the same problem with mine. I love mine. Have had it for 2 months now. So far so good.Fingers crossed 🤞,Took off 2 stars cuz one is defective,2023-07-16,3.0

This is a budget Android smartphone. However, when it comes to the BLU G61S, that isn’t an entirely bad thing. Full disclosure, I’m not a smartphone expert, but I’m not exactly ignorant when it comes to features. If this tells you a little bit more about my smartphone usage, I’m not really one to take pictures on my phone except for rare occurrences. That being said, I’ll do my best to give this phone as comprehensive of a review after a day of use as I can. Also, the attached image is to show an example picture I took from the balcony of my apartment.The sad thing about my experience when purchasing this phone was there wasn’t enough viable information about it when searching online. Which is my purpose of writing this review. I bought this phone as a replacement since I needed one for my lifeline. The one I originally had (A Galaxy S6 Edge…an older phone) I gave to my wife since she needed a phone for work and it was unlocked. Prior to buying this phone, I had also been using a OnePlus Nord N20 5G phone (which I’d consider a mid-range phone). I tried to get a phone as close to the specs of the Nord N20 without breaking the bank, and this was close enough in my budget.PROS:-The extras this phone came with went above and beyond. The rugged case in includes was made with this phone in mind. I had tried to get a case for my old S6 Edge before and it was an off-brand case that required me to force down buttons to wake the phone and adjust the volume. With this phone, simple button presses.- The size of the screen. I went in looking for a phone with a larger screen, around the same size as my Nord N20 and this phone fit the bill. Also just a little bit lighter than my N20 without the case- Call quality. This will also be in the CONS because the call quality is middle of the road. After having called a couple of people, the quality can be a bit hit or miss.- FM Radio. Kind of a novelty in my eyes but still pretty cool. Requires you plug in ear buds to use it. And yes, it has a headphone jack.- Speaker volume. The speaker when playing audio gets nice and loud. My initial test was playing a song from YouTube. Sound quality shines when using ear buds, in my opinion.CONS:- The screen quality looks to be just a little washed out compared to my Nord N20 but it’s not entirely bad. Colors just look a little cooler than what I’m used to. Maybe a minor nit-pick on my end.- No fast charging. It’s more of a nit-pick with it being a USB-C connection. I guess I was a little spoiled by my N20’s fast charging.-Call quality, again. My first test call was to my daughter and she told me it sounded like I was echoing a bit.- Game performance. I get that this phone isn’t a powerhouse, but with 4GB ram I thought it might run Pokemon TCG Live. Barely got 10-15 FPS in a match. Tried Pokemon GO and the AR camera did some weird things when trying to catch Pokemon. Those were the only two games I tested as of writing this review.- Mobile Services. This phone comes with a program that likes to install a bunch of random bloatware and games. On the flip side, it also keeps the phone’s OS automatically updated. The games are nothing too intrusive and can easily be uninstalled as can pretty much any app. My recommendation is to disable this app ASAP and manually check for updates whenever possible in the settings.Do I recommend this phone? As long as you know what to expect, yes. If you’re buying this phone thinking you’re going to get top of the line, cutting edge features, look elsewhere. If you’re on a budget and need a phone for basic purposes, buy this phone. I only paid a little over $80 for it and I'd say that's a fair price for what you're getting. I also think it’s an ideal phone for when you need something cheap and quick until you’re able to get something nicer or a phone for a kid or teenager who might not be as careful with their technology.UPDATE - After 9 days of useAfter using this phone for 9 days, I think I have a better grasp on what this phone can do and how well it does it. When it comes to Spotify, this phone does pretty well. One of my other complaints, and it's minor, is how difficult it can be to dismiss notifications. I have to drag my finger completely across the screen just to (sometimes) dismiss a notification. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries, but it'll eventually go away. I'm also a fan of how bright the flash is on this phone for the flashlight. I stand behind my initial recommendation. This is a great cheap phone for someone who needs a cheap phone.",Keep Expectations In Check - Honest First Impression Review of the BLU G61S 1 & 9 Days In,2023-07-21,5.0,R2OSCCOXS0Y3F5,Buckshot50,0.0,"The battery doesent last anywhere near 3 Days as advertised as it goes from 100 to 20% in the course of 10 hours of just being in my pocket playing mp3 and flac through bluetooth. Speaking of bluetooth, the audio stutters alot for a second when the screen turns on from being off, and speaking of the screen, I only want the screen to turn on when I hit the power button, not when im walking and its in my pocket draining battery and cause audio stutters, I even have every possible screen gesture turned off in the settings that would turn it on without hitting the power button and it still does it. For $80 you could have bought an old carrier unlocked flagship phone off eBay that would be both more powerful in terms of raw performance, and headache free in terms of bluetooth audio and will stay off in your pocket. If you are looking for battery life, save your money and get a Moto G Stylus 5G that phone's battery lasted a literal week of just being asleep all the time and the battery lasts 2-3 days just watching youtube and listening to music on a daily.",Not the greatest,2023-09-25,3.0

I don't do a lot with my phone other than check out Facebook and stream a few shows anyway. The only warning I have is use a fast/high wattage charger.

I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.",An exceptional budget phone on par with bigger brands,2023-07-20,5.0,R3KY8STDM8WL9G,Jason,18.0,"First, I want to say I've only had a couple of days with this phone. However, with only a couple of days, this is my experience and what I have learned. I have Verizon. A normal 5G plan. Regardless what the posting says, this phone DOES WORK on Verizon networks. There is, however, a disclaimer here with all of my testing. I have a 5G SIM card for Verizon. When inserted, it does immediately pick up Verizon signals. All APN's check out fine and the same as my other Verizon Branded phones. Texts, multimedia pictures, and 5G data ALL WORK without issues. Calling, however, does NOT! I have tried changing settings and APN values with no resolve. I went as far as to go to an actual Verizon store (never do that lol) to get help setting it up. Verizon will try to claim it isn't compatible when I can say first hand it absolutely is! Now, here is the strange thing... I used another 4gLTE SIM card and EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECTLY! VoLTE lit up on the bars and I was also getting 5G speeds/signals as well. (For those whom aren't aware, there is essentially no difference in a 4gLTE and 5G SIM card. They both run on both bands. VoLTE is HD Calling which is necessary for Verizon networks now a days. But it does seem that this phone does not read the HD Calling (VoLTE) features on 5G cards. In my case, I was not able to get a new 4gLTE SIM card through Verizon as they only offer 5G SIM cards now. I do have my old 4gLTE SIM card and tried to have it activated but they said ""I would be going backwards and lose my current plan"". Again, there essentially is no difference in the cards. This is just Verizon being more of a pain in the a$$ than needed. I was using my 4gLTE SIM card on my current plan and using it with a 5G phone. No changes. I only changed to a 5G SIM card because I was looking to ""upgrade"" to a new SIM. My mistake clearly.So for those who want this phone on Verizon, YES it is absolutely possible! Just be sure you have a 4gLTE SIM card and everything works perfect. If you have a 5G SIM, everything works EXCEPT calling!As for the phone itself, again I only had a couple of days with it but I did test out many of its features. It was super fast. Zero lag or hangups. I did load it with all of my heavy usage apps and played with it quite a bit before I realized the calling wasn't working. I was using data and texting so I assumed everything was great. Until I tried making a call of course. Camera was pretty good with a beautiful clear picture. What I loved most about this phone was the extra custom programmable button on the side! I seriously wish other phone manufacturers would follow this lead. From quick launching an app to something as simple as enabling the flashlight without having to turn the phone on and finding the icon in the status bar. Amazing feature to have! No bloatware. Fit and feel were, in my opinion, what I would expect on a phone. It is a plastic case but overall weight and feel were great! Screen clarity was also very pleasant.All in all, I would absolutely recommend this phone given you're able to use it with your 4gLTE SIM card. You will absolutely still get your 5G speeds and such. Good luck!Update: I was contacted by a representative from Umidigi. She seemed to be extremely polite and fully admitted on their part of perhaps not having the correct radio bands built into the phone. Hopefully a future OTA Update can fix the issue. However, as with many sellers on here putting an image for more sales seems to be more important. I was offered ""full refund while keeping the device"" if I were to remove my real world review. First of all, the device was already returned so I wasn't getting anything ""free"". Secondly, I don't feel my review on this phone was horrible. I praised the phone for what it is. But I also feel it is just as important for others to be aware if they're also on the Verizon network. If you use other networks I'm sure it'll be perfect. Again, the phone and the built-in specs are amazing in my opinion. I just wish it would have worked on Verizon's VoLTE on a 5G SIM. Best of luck to this company and I'll look into them again in the future. As for now, I have went the Xiaomi Poco X5 Pro 5G and this phone is just absolutely incredible for its price point! And yes, everything works as it should. I'll have a review on that soon!",For those on Verizon network... READ THIS!,2023-08-14,1.0

If you're reading this and it's not on sale, and you don't mind the big guys... Keep it moving. This phone isn't worth the asking price on build quality alone. But if you see this anywhere under 8 hundos, and you're ready to buy the optional 68 watt charger (moto made, and verified compatible) then read on my friend, and let tell you about this hidden gem.Build quality: Looks good, but can feel a bit cheap with the plastic frame. Buy a case and forget about it ( I got a Poetic case). The volume buttons are above the power button, you get used to it but still not the best configuration. The phone does heat up while gaming, charging the battery, and taking pictures. HOWEVER, after having done a throttle test, I can tell you that the heat management is very good, and the performance loss never dipped under 80% over half an hour, nor did temperatures pass 50c.Hardware:Screen is accurate but not bright, with slightly cooler tones out of the box. There are limited adjustment options available in settings. Direct sunlight visibility is just OK, definitely functional. The auto frame rate adjust is great and saves battery... But that 144 frame rate is buttery smooth.Signal : I'm on At&t, and initially assumed that I would be stuck on 4g. First I installed the sim, then At&t sent an update a day later and after resetting the phone 5G was available!!! No dropped or missed calls at all.Speakers are loud but a bit tinny until adjusted. Dolby equaliser should be set to film (surround sound) and pick the treble boost Sub option. Bass boost sub options are available as well. If you leave Dolby on automatic, they focus more on voices than music, so it's great for non music target.Battery life is pretty good on a heavy day, excellent for everyday use. Easily getting over 6 - 7 SoT, even with heavy use ( ex. hours of YouTube playback, Genshin Impact, taking pictures, and making calls) I haven't dipped anywhere near the 5's. The optional 68 watt charger has me topped off in a little less than an hour. Buy it, it makes the phone into a certified beast. This phone can also charge other devices when they are connected via USB c cable.Camera : physically very cool design, motorala's photo app is not so cool. Strange colour science they chose to roll with for photos. It is the phone's greatest weakness. Xda forums has a working version of Gcam alongside the. Xml config file. It changes everything! All of a sudden, you're in the big boy camera game too. And you can even change Gcam to the default camera for your moto gestures!gcam-for-edge-x30-edge-30-pro-edge-plus-2022-working-night-mode-face-retouch-config-file.4391919/#post-86297887..... This is a clue how you get there. Research how to use the xml file and where to put it. Good luck.Software :Its stock android with moto mods mixed in. The unlocked version doesn't come with a lot of useless apps. If you're obsessed with security updates then you won't like it.  You can use whichever launcher you want, but I think stock does a pretty good job.The software excitement comes with Ready For (aka Motorola Dex) Trust me guys n gals, it's legitimate and not a gimmick. I've played emulators on big screens, checked my emails with portable monitors, and basically made my laptop obsolete. It's that dang good. Plus it can recognise the display output of the device it's connected to and adjust. Get yourself a Bluetooth keyboard, a Usbc to hdmi cable, and a Bluetooth video game remote. The all in one experience is finally here, there, and anywhere a compatible device can be connected or cast to.Pro tips: Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec, and it makes compatible headphones sound truly amazing. I've found that Apt-X Adaptable can be a bit laggy on this phone, and honestly didn't change much more than normal Apt-X. Trust me, if you don't know anything about Bluetooth codecs and wonder if it's worth the hassle, just try it once for comparison and thank me later.The Motorola Edge+2022 has less available resources under this name as compared to Motorola Edge 30 pro. They're the same phone and can share the same resources. This will double the amount of advice and information you can find.Even though it looks like the sim tray can accept two cards... It can't. I tried.Developer mode . Change the animation speed to x.5, change the default Bluetooth codec, change the World. Don't play around too much or you'll brick your phone. Every time you connect a new device you'll have to check the Bluetooth codec option to change it. The phone should do it automatically after the first time.If you've made it this far.. Thank you for taking the time. If you do decide to buy this phone, I'd like to welcome you to a very small and exclusive group of people.

The battery life is poor I get around 3.5 hours of screen time. Which is disappointing I came from a Oneplus 9 pro which had a smaller battery and a less efficient processer. But the battery life of that phone when new was probably close to 6 hours. I think the phone has bad firmware that causes the battery drain. For one thing if you are viewing a mostly dark screen and not doing anything you can see the screen brightness flicker (yes auto brightness is off). I assume due to the phone changing power states. Its very distracting.The software is mostly good, the gestures and karate chop to turn on the flashlight are nice. I can not get the phone to stay connected to a poor signal WIFI. Usually there is a toggle switch to turn off constantly looking for a better signal. The only solution I've found is to pull the sim card entirely, which is a shameThe fingerprint reader is nice, but if you leave your phone on the desk and approve 2fa all day its not actually as convenient as a screen finger print reader. So this might be a personal preferenceI only tried the ""ready for"" on WIFI, and it wasn't actually very useful more than just plain old screen sharing. But maybe you could have a use for it, like showing notifications on your desktop. I'm sure wired is way better but didn't try it outMacro camera on this is great, honestly I don't use the other cameras muchI love a flat screen, I really wish more high end phones came with a flat screen. its a beautiful phone, too bad putting a case on it ruins the look, and ruins the feel in hand/great haptics of this phone. I also wish this phone was 16/512GB. That is the ideal spec in my mind.

The phone is light weight, could be a pro or con for you. The camera lenses are sleek, they are not ugly and bulky like some of the other cheap phones. The camera quality is acceptable. It's not the deal breaker for me. The corners of the phone are nice and rounded giving it a sleek appearance and feel. It's got a slim profile and feels easy to hold, not large or bulky. The phone is plastic but that's not noticeable once you put a case on it anyway. The phone speed is fast enough. It's not too glitchy. The main drawback for me is the lower screen quality than other phones in it's price range like the umidigi. The screen almost appears faded. My usual phone is a Samsung Galaxy s 22+. The umidigi had a surprisingly similar screen quality for such a cheap phone. Whereas, this doogee has about what you would expect from $100 phone. The screen looks grainy a bit and the color hues are off. I also don't like that the time display area at the top left of the screen is partially cut off. It is misaligned. So you can't see the top of the number. It's still functional I guess because I can still tell what time is displayed but it represents a quality and design issue to me. Also, when the case is on it the fingerprint reader accuracy is decreased. Due to the placing. The speaker volume is good. The phone seemed unable to maintain as good as a connection to my wifi as other devices. I didn't test it out long but I noticed it dropped a connection multiple times so I ended up turning off the wifi. That was another reason I decided to return it.

Because after I and placed my sim and went through the setup process.The phone repeatedly told me that is could not connect to wifi after it already had.Then the phone went into something called extreme battery saver and we could not turn it off thus causing a black screen with only six apps showing. We had to use the virtual assistant to get into settings  because it would not allow any access to anything else in the phone.This finally resulted in me having to call Amazon support.  They have no data or information to trouble shoot this phone.  So the had me factory restore it.

I had planned to write a review comparing the two phones (e.g., size, weight, features, battery life, and so on). Since the Posh Micro does not appear to be available any more, there's no use in writing that review. In summary, though, the Unihertz Jelly is the superior phone -- although I did like the slightly smaller size of the Posh Micro -- but it failed in one feature: the GPS. Other reviewers have noted the erratic nature of the GPS and for me it was virtually useless. When I used it to navigate, it suddenly had me off the interstate and driving through neighborhoods several blocks away. This phone would be a great tool to use when running, especially when wearing it with the optional armband, but without a functioning GPS, I couldn't reliably track my run. A five mile loop around Stone Mountain turned into 6.95 mile straight line, though the GPS did generously shave a couple minutes off my pace!So, I contacted Unihertz support. They informed me that they had made improvements in the GPS and, since my phone was still under warranty, offered to exchange it if I would ship my phone to China. I was reluctant to do so since, first, I relied on my phone every day and, second, shipping to China by a trackable means isn't cheap. Still, I backed up my data, reset the phone to the factory setting, and shipped it.Meanwhile, I resurrected my old Posh Micro, which loosely fit in the Unihertz armband. It told me that a 3.1 mile (5 kilometer) run through the woods was 3.09 miles. Wow! Subsequent runs were similarly accurate. I kept my fingers crossed for the replacement Jelly.When it finally arrived, I eagerly took it for a run. It measured that same 3.1 mile course through the woods as 3.15 miles. The GPS told me the five miles around Stone Mountain is a loop of 5.15 miles. In addition, it reports changes in elevation, which the previous Jelly did not. It's still not 100% accurate, since a couple times it has dumped me off the interstate when I'm driving, and it straightened out a curvy stretch of trail when running. But, my daughter's expensive Garmin watch sometimes misreports her runs, so that might be the nature of GPS.So, Unihertz has indeed addressed the GPS issue. I'm happy with the phone, which I can comfortably store in my pocket. I can run with it, listening to podcasts and reasonably accurately tracking my route and pace. Since Georgia passed a hands free driving law, I can use Bluetooth earbuds or connect to my car stereo and use Android Auto to navigate in traffic, send and receive phone calls and texts, and listen to music and podcasts. But it has to stay plugged in because Android Auto will flatten the battery pretty quickly!UPDATES: A question was asked below about Android Auto. For unknown reasons, Amazon won't let me reply. But here's my answer: It's odd that this is mentioned in the specs and I wonder if it might have applied to the phone when it was initially available. I use Android Auto regularly. Generally, it works fine, with occasional quirks (e.g., it won't initiate text messages, it reads then deletes messages I've received). I don't know if this is the app or the phone, but restarting the app usually cures it.  It does consume a lot of power, especially Google Maps, so I keep the phone plugged in when running it.Now, for the GPS. Last week, it was pouring rain. My wife was driving with her Motorola phone running Waze. I was in the passenger seat with the Unihertz Jelly running Google Maps. I watched while my phone repeatedly lost contact with the GPS. A few seconds later and it reconnected, only to drop again. I attributed that to the cloud cover, but my wife's Motorola never lost contact.The next week, while driving on the interstate in clear weather, the GPS kept moving me onto side streets while Google Maps told me to make a u-turn. However, my phone has been dead on during my runs, except for running in the rain, when it got lost in the woods.The bottom line is that the GPS is much, much better, but it's not perfect. That may be a lot to ask for such a small phone. Still, I'm generally quite pleased.",GPS Update,2018-07-29,5.0,R3FP8OME4032EY,Just a Bro,1.0,Low battery life.With not much daily use battery wouldn't make it to the end of the day.It was a really fun and easy phone to use.Swipe texting was really simple unless I needed to type numbers.Speaker not so good unless you use bluetooth but with a small battery the bluetooth will drain it fast,Get what you pay for,2023-09-01,3.0

This was their direct response:“This is the latest version of the system. security updates match the system version. Not every software version will be updated. If a new security updates is released, you can view it on your phone.”That is a categorically false statement. My previous phone ran Android 11 and the latest security update from it was April 2023. If OnePlus can release updates for a 2½  year-old phone then humidity can release updates for a <1 year-old phone. This race is very serious red flags about Umidigi and their ability to provide a safe mobile environment.Original:I've always carried flagship Android phones, but after OnePlus and Verizon ruined my last phone with a terrible Android upgrade and then NO bug fixes I had to find something new. I was tired of buying from Verizon because their phones take forever to get updates/upgrades because they force every phone maker (except Apple and Google because they don't allow it) to customize Android for Verizon, forcing bloatware like Verizon Messages, Verizon location services, and other unnecessary apps, none of which are you allowed to uninstall. Oh, and don't forget, the Verizon malware app, ""Verizon App Manager""  (that used to be called DT Ignite)that installs unwanted apps on your phone without your permission or approval. Also, Verizon's fake 5G network is no faster than 4G in most places.So that said I went looking for unlocked, factory default alternatives. Samsung and Google both offer these, but at very high price points so I kept looking. Then I stumbled on this Umidigi Bison 2 Pro. For $200 its specs looked too good to be true, but for $200 I had to try it. I have, mostly, not been disappointed. Here's what I've found in a few days of using it:1) Let me get this out of the way first. Support is by email ONLY and goes to China where they take at least 48 hours to reply. For $200 I'm ok with that.2) Documentation is, to say the least, basically nonexistent.3) For this to work on Verizon you have to do two things. First, change the network from Global to LTE. Second, turn on VoLTE. Once those are done this phone will connect to Verizon, including using WiFi Calling if you wish and Verizon Network Extenders (I have one in my house, because otherwise I can't hear you now).4) Performance has been exceptional for a phone of this price. No, you're not going to get Samsung S23 Pro or an iPhone 14 Pro performance, but day-to-day apps like email, social media, banking, etc work great with no  launching or moving around inside the apps.5) this phone has an option for an external microSD card. As with other Androids with this capability, the microSD card can be configured to either act as part of the phone, meaning the card is encrypted and can't be moved to a different phone, where apps will install by default as well as their data, or the microSD card can be configured as an external storage device that will not be encrypted but that you cannot install apps on. My experience with this is the microSD card, I bought a SanDisk Extreme, is it's less than reliable. Quite often the phone would pop up and say the microSD card was not inserted please reinsert it, powering the phone down and then back on got it to see the microSD card again. I finally just moved my apps back to the internal 256GB memory and set up Sandisk Memory Zone (free in the Play Store and also has no ads!). This app can be scheduled to automatically backup your photos, videos, contacts, messages, etc to your microSD card. Takes all of 2 minutes to set up.6) The display is bright and crisp, easily visible in bright sunlight. Unlike some Android phones the auto brightness feature actually works quite well. Auto brightness changes the brightness significantly quicker than other Androids I've owned. Again, no you're not going to get a top-of-the line Samsung or Apple display here, but it's 90 HZ refresh rate makes using it very nice and colors are deep and rich.7) Now let's talk about battery life. So far it's been okay, but as in other reviews online, this definitely does not give you the battery life of some other phones that have similar or even slightly smaller batteries. Some of this could be due to my time configuring a new phone, I don't allow one Android to copy everything from an old Android I would rather set things up to start with. Copying from one phone to another works great from iPhone to iPhone but it just has never worked well from Android to Android. I'll use it for another week or two and try to remember to come back and update this at that time.8) Despite their claims, charging is not fast. It comes with an 18 Watt charger and USB-C cable, but charging this phone using the same charger, it's a SlimQ GAN 4-port 100 watt charger that I only have two devices plugged into, it takes far longer to charge from 10% to 100%, then my previous OnePlus 8 does. It doesn't seem to make a difference whether I use their charging block or the SlimQ. So while for most people charging is not an issue if they do it overnight, if you need a quick top off during the day don't expect it to be fast.8) The overall build of this phone might be the best feeling phone I have ever owned. Since it carries military drop spec ratings, this phone feels like it's built like a brick, and not in a bad way. The phone is solid, it doesn't feel cheap nor does it feel like they used lower quality materials for a $200 phone. The phone comes with its case built into it with very good protection on the corners and back, though I would have preferred that the case covered the small camera bump. Speaking of the case, the only glass on this phone is in the front, unlike some of the other phone manufacturers who have insisted on putting glass on the back of the case that's easily broken. Since the case is built in you will not need to spend money on a new case. That also means you can't change the case, but honestly it feels great in your hands, it's smooth and quite functional.9) Camera quality is something I've had a chance to test a lot with, but as you can see from the attached photos colors are rich and well reproduced, at least in sunlight. I'm not expecting it to be the quality of my iPhone 13 Pro Max 1TB, but that phone cost $1600.9) this phone has built-in sensors for barometer and temperature. The temperature sensor can be used to read human body temperature or object temperature.10) This phone ships with Android 12 and given the $200 cost I'm not expecting a lot of upgrades, but at $200 I can just replace it every year with the next version of the same phone.That said, this phone ships with April 2022 Android security update. There really can't be any excuse for that, I have reached out the manufacturer to find out when that will be corrected. Since this is a very, very vanilla flavor of android, it should be very simple for them to put out Android security updates on a regular basis.11) Following up on #10, the only OEM software that ships with this are tools to utilize the sensors on the phone. See  included screenshot. The temperature and barometric pressure sensors seem to be quite accurate. I have to say, the picture hanging app and the protractor app are pretty slick, and not something I've seen on a lot of other phones.12) Since this doesn't ship with many OEM apps, it ships with generic Google apps, most of which you cannot remove even if you want to. I, for example, never use Duo but it's stuck here. You can disable it, but you can't remove it. It's unfortunate that Google has such high opinion of itself that it has to force people to keep their apps on a phone. If their apps are really that good, people would install them or leave them installed and use them.13) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity have been smooth and error-free. I have connected this phone to multiple Wi-Fi networks in multiple locations, paired it with a Plantronics headset, and paired it with my car.14) One slick feature of this $200 phone is it two customizable orange buttons. One on the lower right and one on the middle left. You have three choices for each button, single click, double click, and long press. I honestly haven't figured out what I'm going to do with all of them, though I did configure the lower right one for double click screenshots.14) biometric scanning is done on the power button on the right side in the middle. It's a little awkward coming from the OnePlus 8 that has on-screen fingerprint, but I much prefer this because that will allow me to use a tempered glass screen protector. The phone does ship with a screen protector pre-installed, but it's plastic and I prefer tempered glass.15) This phone has a 3.5 mm audio jack, something not found on any high-end phone and most others have ditched them as well. This is a welcome change in my older car it doesn't have a Bluetooth stereo.Anyways, that's my initial review of the Umidigi Bison 2 Pro phone. Like I said, with the lack of updates and the fact that it is only a $200 phone, I could replace this in a year with another $200 version of this phone and not lose any sleep over it, but if it is as durable as it feels now, I may not have to do that, assuming the manufacturer comes up with some updates. Give it a try, as long as you come at it with the right expectations, I think you will very much enjoy this phone.","Wow for the price, but beware..",2023-06-03,4.0,R1UU9PL6XRY6KZ,Ron Novak,7.0,"SEE REVISION 3 BELOW…Revision 3At 30 days, the second Bison 2 Pro I have tested (bought) wouldn’t boot after shutting down and attempting a restart. After an hour of messing, I discovered that you can force a reboot by holding down both volume buttons and the power button through a reboot cycle (mine would get to the fist restart screen and repeat every 15 seconds)(such instructions should be in the “user manual”, and the “technical staff” have yet to answer my request for help). I don’t want to worry about this nonsense on a trip in a foreign city or on a trail in the bush. I don’t want to have to carry my iPhone 8 as a backup…….I have downgraded this device to 2 stars because of the unreliability of the 2 units I have worked with, and because of the mediocre quality of the camera and the device’s inability to deliver quality sound through my hearing aids….. Not to mention that it can’t automatically restart Verizon VOLTE after the signal has been lost for some reason. The “technical staff” offer no help in correcting any of the problems with this device, they just suggest that you should up your rating…… Worthless….. (Eva and Evan, are you listening?)If you buy one, I hope you have better luck than I have had. The Bison is a great concept that I really wanted to work. But the two units I had failed to deliver….. I may re-try in a year when the product line had matured, but not now. I have ordered an F3 and hope it is as good as the A11 I bought for my ex-wife…. I’ll comment on that device after I have used it for a while…….. UMIDIGI products offer good bang-for-the-buck, if you can get them to keep running past a month! Hope springs eternal!Revision 2I received the replacement Bison 2 Pro on 01 March, around four days after I requested the replacement, good for Amazon and Umidigi! I have used the replacement exclusively since 01/03. As I mentioned, it connects with Verizon without a problem and it connects to my hearing aids with Bluetooth as well. The other day, I connected it to my 2019 Volvo with Bluetooth (the Volvo doesn't have an audio jack) so I can play music from the phone through the car's infotainment system. It all works.I have been emailing the tech support folks at Umidigi who are concerned with the failure of the first phone and the condition of the replacement. They seem genuinely concerned and want feedback on their products. Asa retired engineer, I'm probably giving them more than they want......In the meantime, I bought an Umidigi G 1 Max, which looked like it had the same specs as the Bison. However, while it would connect to Verizon, but the phone and texting didn't work. After hours of research and talking with a Verizon ""technical support"" person, I have new knowledge about the reason the G 1 didn't work and the Bison does. Verizon uses VOLTE 4G and bands 2, 4, 13, and 66. The G1 lacks band 13, QED...... I returned the device to Amazon and bought a Umidigi A11. I wanted a lighter, smaller phone for everyday use. The A11 has band 13 (along with the other requirements) and it works with Verizon!BOTH OF THESE CELLPHONES COST AROUND HALF OF THE COST OF A NEW iPhone 13!!!!!!! I will not upgrade to the iPhone 13 from my dying iPhone 8..... Not going back to Apple, EVER!ORIGINAL.....I have changed my evaluation from 2 stars to 4 stars for the Bison and the A11 due to the quality of the devices and the conversations with the staff at Umidigi. I may give the products the last star if they continue to give good service in the coming months......So far - so good on the Bison 2Pro phone. I bought it to replace an iPhone 8 for a trip to Europe later this year. First hurdle, does it work with Verizon? Yes it does, however I haven’t officially set it up with them, just plugged in the SIM and made a call and texted. Second hurdle, does it work with my Bluetooth hearing aids? Yes it does, beams sound directly into my head….. Next hurdle, can I adapt my brain away from the world of iPhone? We’ll see over the next few months. Good news, I have used Dragon Touch tablets for years and am used to Android there.REVISION:After 2 weeks, the Bison screen has gone to black and white, and has started blinking on and off. The on and off behavior has no relation to touching the screen or buttons. Unacceptable. I contacted the seller about the charger being DOA, but they haven’t replaced it. Asked questions indicating user error! Unacceptable behavior! I’m returning the phone for a replacement (basically, I like the phone) and we’ll see how the next one goes. I live 20 miles from Santa Fe, NM, and depend on my phone in case of emergency. Can’t have it crapping out……. See Revision 2, above.....",I quit after second Bison 2 Pro crapped,2023-02-16,2.0

This is true of the A15, as it has been with the F1,  Bison, & Bison Pro I previously purchased.It is important to note, however, that often these phones perform at levels less than you would expect given the tech spec sheet they arrive with.Primarily, this will be most evident to end-users  when using the camera on their device. If you compare their camera performance to other premium brands such as Apple, Samsung, or Sony you will find that despite the high megapixel count the photos you take will lack the software optimizations that their competitors include - you may get all the pixels of the 64MP photo, but the clarity, focus, and color levels often do not match the quality that even lower megapixel cameras of premium brand phones achieve.Operating in conditions like low light or using features such as macro mode may make those differences more prominent and pronounced. This has improved over time with their handsets, but users should be aware that this difference in photo quality exists and will be difficult to overcome even for power or pro-level camera users.Another area in which you may find that performance seems to deviate from the stated specifications is in speed of multi-tasking and graphical processing capabilities.I have done a side by side speed check of similar operations with this handset vs. OnePlus 8 Pro 5G and despite the 12GB of RAM on that handset being 25% less powerful compared to the A15 it was considerably and consistently slower than the OnePlus.This is more an anecdotal, unscientific comparison, but if one benchmarks this via Antutu or other performance benchmarking apps, I would expect the results would be consistent with my observations.The build quality of the A15 is acceptable but not exceptional. When the handset has been active and is warmed up, you can put moderate pressure on the screen lens for a couple seconds and feel a small amount of malleability and compression occur, meaning it has glass that is not of a higher mohs hardness you would expect from a similar competitor offering, and I have found their screens more easily broken than other Gorilla Glass lenses and LCD's.A word of caution regarding the warranty and build quality of Umidigi products. Of the 4 I have received, one had a broken microphone out of the box that even failed their factory QC feature check. Despite months of back and forth with Umidigi, they refused to offer to take it back to repair or send me a replacement. They ghosted me after 2 months of consistent messaging on eBay, where I purchased it from their official account. After doing some research, this was not a unique experience and many forums will tell you that as a general rule, except for the immediate return grace period there is no recourse for any product failure or defect.OS Updates are seldom for these phones and I would not expect them to be updated past the initial Android version. Security updates are relatively non-existent.This does not bother me, but temper your expectations if you are hoping for long-lasting device support.All that is not to say that I haven't been happy with their product for the price, when it worked out of the box. Despite the lackluster camera features, their phones have been a good value for the price and performance has been acceptable if not impressive for the budget.One very welcome highlight of these phones is the 5,000+ mAh batteries that they contain. Though charging on previous devices has not been extremely fast, they do last an impressive length of time and after a year on 2 of them with moderate to heavy use they discharged pretty slowly. This has been one of my favorite qualities in these phones and I have nothing but praise for Umidigi in this regard. Comparably, OnePlus and Samsung handsets I have owned have fared considerably worse on battery life past the 1 year mark, although charging them is slightly faster.I also would point out that their speaker quality hasn't left much to be desired and is better than other budget handsets in the same price range.Their screen brightness is somewhat lower at maximum setting than other phones and less visible in direct sunlight, but this has not been a deal breaker in my experience. You will find it you like a brighter screen experience that anything less than 80%+ is essentially useless, but this doesn't seem to be a huge drain on the battery life, which may in and of itself be an indicator of the brightness level range generally.The fingerprint readers have been placed intuitively on their handsets and work modestly well, but they pale in comparison to Apple, Samsung, and OnePlus. I get about 25% success rate when using them, and often default to using the alternative unlock method after multiple attempts.In summary, there are drawbacks to purchasing budget phones in terms of performance and quality, but Umidigi has stuck a fairly impressive value-for-money compromise and if the unit you receive works and you donr require after-purchase support you'll likely feel good about your pirchaae if you have reasonable expectations, but if those conditions are not met, you will have wasted your money and no amount of time with their customer service support will change that.3J9H+FJ Brooklyn Park, MNSo put the phone through an extensive evaluation during the return period and do not hesitate to return it if it isn't what you wanted.If you don't return it, you'll likely feel like you've gotten a good deal of phone for not a great deal of money.Oh, and it comes with a case and screen protector and a very solid AC charger and cable in a very attractive box.

There's a mode on the A14 camera where you use it to it's potential and while it's noticeable, it's not a huge difference between my daily S10e.Sound - this phone can get very loud without headphones which can be either good or bad but if you're blasting the phone with no one caring around you, why can't this be just a good thing?Color - the huge screen is nice to watch shows/videos/movies on and the colors on it are very vivid--as expected from any Samsung phone. Also this green is a very nice color that most phones don't have as an option coming out of the box.Cons:Ram - now this was a HUGE reason why I decided to return this phone. It might be because it only has 4gb ram, or that the processor is different than the Snapdragon processors found in the S series phones, but this phone was very obviously, noticeably, and painfully slow. I'm a patient person but it got to the point where it was frustrating just opening an app that doesn't require much ram. When it came to streaming videos on YouTube that was fine, but doing some gaming or going on Instagram it was very laggy and felt delayed and slow with response time. This problem was more obvious on Instagram. All the videos were playing but the audio wasn't synced with the video and that goes to show you how slow the phone is. I've tried many ways to fix this issue; a clean reinstall, clearing cache, resetting the phone, but it kept persisting and Instagram is one of the apps I use often so having it continue was not going to work for me.NFC - although not a huge con, it is useful to have NFC on your phone whereas this version of the A14 doesn't come with NFC.No stereo speaker - this A14 doesn't have a speaker on the top side by the camera unlike most phones so when you're listening to anything on this phone, it's only coming from the bottom/right side of the phone by the charger.Touch responses - it might be paired with the ram/speed situation but the touch response was off about this phone. I use Gboard to swipe text and while I've had no problems using swipe text on my S10e, this one kept ending my swipes early, inputting words with letters I was never even close to swiping on. It made texting very frustating.Video recording - while the camera is nice, recording videos on this phone is very limited. You can't do 1080p 60fps so you're locked to 1080p 30fps which isn't bad but having the option would've been nice. Granted this phone was less than $200 so you might have expected less features.",Good phone if you're on a budget,2023-10-04,3.0

This is habit I was trying to get out of already die to pain in my pinky from holding my phone. This seems easier to hold in my new way because it is probably around an inch deep. The phone weighs almost 1.5 lbs. So if you don't realize that, you may want to be aware. This is not an issue for me and I hope it helps work my weak wrist.This phone is unlike most phones in that you do not swipe up to get to your apps...they are ALL on your home screen pages. I found that odd and at first didn't like it, because when filing my apps in folder I sometimes forget which one I put some in. That o have found there is not a search, BUT if you go to the apps manager and click apps, you can find and open an app you lost from there. The downside to this is that you can't create duplicates of icons on your home screen...most probably don't do that anyway. I do, because I like to put a calculator on my home and in my financial folder to make things easier. This isn't that big of a deal though. I love the space this phone has though....I definitely won't find this phone ever bogging down because of the space being close to full. There is plenty of memory. You also can use this phone as a charger for other phones, which I thought is an awesome feature when in a pinch (I definitely won't make a habit but it can come in handy sometimes) I do usually like to keep my phone on auto for the brightness....I probably womt with this phone because when trying to take a pic I noticed the brightness isn't bright enough for me to see. The default is quite low for the auto brightness. You can easily manually do so though. Let me add, if you can't get the settings menu to pop up by swiping down the top of your screen and only get the notification bar .....be aware you have to swipe towards the right top....not the left. This isn't a big deal, but a good fact to know about this phone. The screen recording is awesome and unlike any I have ever seen. It allows you to choose if it records the audio or not and the screen touches as well. It is easily accessed by swiping down on the screen and clicking S-capture. The night mode is a cool feature I like. It records in black and white, but you can see everything even in the darkness. This actually could save a life of there is ever an intruder and the lights are off or even outside in the night. It takes decent pictures as well. It can be used under the water when in water mode and is safe from dust as well. It is easy to charge and comes with a US plug(my old phone did not). It also does not come with malware or bloat ware. I only had some Google apps preinstalled but nothing that seemed like it was trying to force things on me like some phones. My old phone which is a famous overseas phone that starts with ""X""....it even came with ads. I hated that. This phone does not do that.

Probably the best I've received. Compact, sturdy, perfect color (dark grey so you can find it in the interior of a black purse, but not as in-your-face as a neon one).CONS:- earbud design is not stable. I thought these might be cushioned differently than your average $15-25 earbuds so they would stay firmly in your ear. They don't. They are different, but they won't stay in your ears securely- no volume control. Admittedly, there is no promise of volume control on the description, but I saw the fat section & jumped to the conclusion that there were controls built in. What I love about the bose is the ability to quickly pause/restart/change volume on the headphones themselves- no microphone (which I knew, but for $40, this is a definite con).All in, I wish I had selected a different pair for my intended use, but it is DEFINITELY better than airplane airbuds, so I am going to keep them instead of returning (insufficient time to replace).*Update* After I posted this review, the seller contacted me multiple times to offer me a replacement line of their earbuds they thought would work better for me. It has been 20+ years since I received such customer service. In an era where casual disrespect and disregard for others is the norm, this was an unexpected pleasure. I upgraded my review by one star to reflect the co's concern for its customers. I will try the new version they send & if I love them, will review the appropriate model.",Best Customer Service Ever (Not for me though),2023-03-29,3.0

I will go into detail about the flaws I noticed. I am using the Google Pixel 3 as reference as that was my last phone before I had to rush to buy this one due to having it stolen.First off, let's start with the pros:PROSGreat Battery life - way better than on the Google Pixel (3).Has a solid build and feel to it - Not quite rugged phone level (unless you get the right case for it.) but it has a sleek design that looks simple but very appealing.Able to uninstall pre loaded apps with no issues.Works with the listed carriers, including way more as long as they fit the requirements. (I am on US mobile and it works fine on there.)Options to save the battery - My pixel had battery saving mode but the one on this phone is extreme and if you keep it on there, it's similar to having a rugged phone with a large battery size. It's pretty nice.Transitions are smooth unless a LOT of apps are running - a tiny (And I mean tiny) bit of lag here and there, but it's to be expected.Headphone jacks - you can use an SD card on this phone - the camera is almost as good as the Google Pixel 3 or 4 (HDR mode) - And of course it comes unlocked.Now we will go to the cons. Keep in mind that I have been rocking the google pixel series phone for almost 4 years. I always compare any phone that I need short term or considering for long term before making a choice. As of this time, I will keep this phone long term until I can afford the latest Google Pixel phone.CONSGames (Raid is one example) must either be set to MED. or below settings or (Like Pokemon Go) the game assets (basically EVERYTHING in the game) would need to be pre-downloaded beforehand. I am only pointing this out because there are a number of gamers that due game on the android platform. From what I notice, sometimes the FPS dips a bit when there are too many things on screen. Very noticeable animation lag. On 2D or simple games, this is NOT an issue. But keep this in mind.Slower download/upload speeds - You will notice it when trying to load a page with a lot of content, or say the reddit app. Even on Wifi, while loads faster, still slower.SLOW CHARGING - I am putting this in caps so that way people know. So this does NOT have fast charging. This is something that I actually miss from my pixel. Now, I do not know if I would need to get a different type of charger or cable but from what I read and have seen, it does not fast charge. It charges a bit slowly, it could be due to the larger battery. But just something to be aware of.Speakers are at the bottom of the phone - This is a con for me. But something to be aware of.Only a year of updates.BOTTOM LINE: If you need an new phone, with *almost* the same performance as a google pixel 3 or 4 if it's just to get you by until you buy your main phone, your kid, your parents, etc I highly recommend this phone. With a good hybrid case, you have yourself a rugged phone that is better than 90% of the ""rugged phones"" that are out there. With a normal thin case, it feels light and slim. It's a very solid option. I just hope they can put in a more powerful chip or even throw on more ram so that way it runs games and apps a lot faster.",Almost as good as a previous genration Google Pixel (3 or 4),2023-04-28,5.0,RM96Z1ATMUG0P,all rights reserved,7.0,"i do not understand what TCL is doing.

This time I chose this rugged smart phone based on a lot of research. Although I had learned a lot of relevant information in advance, I was still shocked when I got this phone.  First of all, it comes with a fully enclosed protective case, which has excellent anti-drop, waterproof and dustproof functions.  It has tough lines, full metallic texture, and a sci-fi feel.  It is equipped with an 8 core processor, plus 16GB RAM + 256GB ROM, which is enough to meet my daily use needs.  I’m sure you’ve never seen a 1,200-lumen camping light on other mobile phones, and a 10,000 mAh large-capacity battery, which makes it a portable power bank.  Although it looks rough, the 2408x1080 resolution still gives you clear vedio quality and rich colors.  Even in the wild, you can still enjoy a perfect visual experience.  The most exciting part is that in addition to the regular 48MP rear camera and 16MP front-facing selfie camera, it is also equipped with a 20MP night vision camera and two infrared lights, which can take clear photos in dark environments at night.  It's incredible that it did.  I am ecstatic about such a smartphone that looks very sci-fi and has a variety of special and practical functions.

My original review is below this update. After several emails back and forth with the seller, I was able to exchange the phone and received a replacement within a day or two. I've been using the replacement phone for a few weeks now and it appears to be working just fine. I'm not sure if maybe I had just received a ""lemon"" or if my issues are more common. I recall reading some other reviews that state that the phone relies too much on Wifi calling and also another review that said something about people on the other end of the call not able to hear you. Both of those reviews are symptoms of what I was going through with the first phone they sent me. My advice would be to make sure Wifi calling is turned off and make several calls to make sure that the other person can hear you. The phone always sounded good on my end, so it was hard to know that there was a problem until the friend I was calling told me about it. If you experience any of those issues, it's a possibility that your phone is afflicted with the same problem and you should contact the seller. (End of updated review).Overall, I really want to like this phone, but one issue stands in the way. This phone is bound and determined to use Wifi calling, even while Wifi calling is turned off. Wifi calling is not reliable at all (which isn't normally a big deal since you can ordinarily just disable that feature) however this phone will pick up any saved/open Wifi network during the middle of a call which makes it impossible for the party on the other end to hear me. Not good for business. Driving down the highway, trying to do business over the phone and if you happen to be passing businesses with open networks, well you can kiss your customers goodbye. What makes it even worse, I've contacted the seller twice about this issue with no response. As I said, I really wanted to like this phone but the issue with the calls along with absolutely no customer service, makes this a 2 star review.","*Updated review* Everything is great, except if you intend to make a phone call.",2022-01-06,4.0,R16SXBNDSI7WRI,Thom,17.0,"UPDATED: Below is my original review. My review includes my personal opinions. Decide for yourself if any of my issues are worth your decision to purchase. *And note the NO Refunds/Returns on this phone* My update is to let the reader know I was offered 4 different payout options to delete my comment and review. Starting at $20 and going up to $50 when I didn't respond. They said they changed manufacturing to improve my concerns. Which is great, but I will not be bribed to change an honest review if it may affect your decision to purchase. I told them I would be happy to provide an updated review with an updated phone to review. I will reiterate from My review, the phone is not overall bad. It just doesn't meet my standards. I would've appreciated the opportunity to read an honest review like this to make my decision. Some of you may still buy this phone, and that is good for you and them! (Although, check the actual website for the phone,I think it's cheaper there) Just do your research and decide for yourself.LAST UPDATE: multimedia/group messages don't download well on wifi. Doesn't come with headphones, which isn't major, I just miss new headphones with the purchase of a new phone.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'll start with the positive that the camera is a lot better than my previous phone (may or may not be best, but all I needed) as well as the screen resolution. Two factors that led me to purchase the phone. It seems to run fairly fast and seems durable. I've had a few people say it's too heavy, but I haven't really noticed. The shortcut buttons are good, but not necessarily in the best location. And in addition, the power and volume buttons all being on the same side are not ideal. Maybe just takes time to get used to.I didn't realize(possibly my lack of research which I thought I did plenty of) it was so reliant on Google. You can't uninstall any of the Google features and the Google Search widget is permanently on the home screen.It seems really glitchy. Several apps will pause and then close out randomly.The wifi calling is horrendous/awful and any worse word you can describe it. I need the wifi calling because my service can be spotty in my facility. It sounds gargled, sometimes even robotic every other word, and will drop frequently.Battery life is sufficient, but I wish I would've selected one with longer power. I can make it through about a day and a half, which I guess is right on with how much I use it. The charging seems to be really slow too.I'm debating returning it... I wouldn't necessarily recommend unless the camera and screen resolution are the only things you need to improve in your phone status.O, the thermometer is cool, but never use it...",Too reliant on Google/horrendous wifi calling,2021-12-03,2.0

Two weeks in, I can say that I really enjoy the Power 3's bright, punchy display which provides nice, deep blacks and vibrant colors without the overly saturated, eye searing, candy tinged garishness of many OLED displays. Fingerprint reader on the back is very fast, and the touch response is mostly responsive but occasionally a tad reluctant. The phone is fine for the limited apps I use, however, so I'm pleased enough with it. It is a heavy device, however, on account of that substantial battery, making it slightly tiresome to hold for any length of time.Where the Power 3 falls short: Scrolling through my photo archive is noticeably more sluggish owing to the 2GB RAM downgrade from my S3 Pro, which had 6GB compared to the Power 3's unexceptional 4GB. The main camera uses the same long-in-the-tooth 48MP sensor which Umidigi has been deploying for several years now. Worst of all, though, is the atrocious speaker, which produces crunchy and distorted audio akin to the transistor radio I had as a kid five decades ago - it's seriously awful, even for a budget device, and a definite step down from the speaker on the S3 Pro...which itself was serviceable but not much more. Umidigi really missed the boat on that one.Judging from postings by other reviewers, the Power 3 is still in its honeymoon period with me. I'll keep watch for any of the more serious issues mentioned. The phone so far has been worth the gamble for the price/battery/display/understated body style, but I won't think twice about bailing on it - and Umidigi entirely - if it begins acting up.Update: After a couple weeks, the distorted and fuzzy sound issue miraculously cleared itself up. Audio is now clear at all volume levels; watching videos or playing MP3 files is enjoyable again. Also, after having sufficient time to test the Power 3's back camera, I'm generally impressed with the results - they're very similar to what I was getting of my late, lamented S3 Pro, just (perhaps) a bit sharper and better in low light. (Samples were taken by the Power 3's main camera and edited largely in the phone's photo app.)  I'm satisfied enough to boost the Power 3 to a four star rating; it's no top of the line Samsung Galaxy or iPhone, but for the hundreds of dollars (if not a grand plus) saved on it over the flagships, it gets the job done nicely. I'll just have to wait and see how well it holds up in the long run. Fingers crossed...",Power player,2021-12-14,4.0,R96971SPA056O,John Smith,7.0,"I rely on the fingerprint sensor/reader to unlock my phone every single time I use it, so to have one totally fail at ONE WEEK of use is a complete deal breaker.Yep, after one week of use this thing was no longer registering fingerprints at all, in fact the phone stopped recognizing that it even had a fingerprint sensor on board, which points to it being a hardware issue that can't be fixed at home. If you search for ""umidigi power 5 fingerprints not working"", you will see that this is a common issue with this phone as well as other Umidigi models. Besides, even when the little side-mounted fingerprint reader was functional (for 6 days), it was very hit-or-miss when using it, so it was clear that this phone probably wouldn't have been a good long-term investment.The other major gripe with the phone is the notifications/call volume being the same setting, so if you want notifications to be silent but still would like to hear incoming calls, you have to adjust the settings for every single app to be silent and low-priority... no idea if this is the standard on new phones, but my old phone had a separate slider for notification volume.As a bit of a sidenote, you will have to install an alternative app launcher if you wish to not have a big, ugly Google search bar right on your home screen, because this phone is intended to be used entirely with Google products out of the box.Also, the point needs to be made that the battery is certainly not 3 days... in fact I'm charging it regularly every day unless I want to be below 50% on day 2... and this is on light-to-intermediate usage mostly involving offline music playback.It's a shame they couldn't get this phone right for me, but I will say; if you don't need a fingerprint reader or silent notifications, this is a pretty good phone for the price point.

BAD COMPANY AND PHONE! SEVERAL ISSUES,0.0,R1VJMUQEKA7TAY,dragoonslayer12,47.0,"I left Android for iPhone about 5 years ago, and I always missed the freedom Android gave me. The ""major"" updates Apple gave had been old features for Android. Recently, I fell in a rabbit hooe searching for Android gaming devices, and decided between this and the Samsung 23 Ultra.I got the 23 Ultra, and instantly fell in love, but the Red Magic 8 Pro was my first pick, as a gaming (emulation) was my priority, so I returned the 23 and grabbed the Translucent 8 Pro. While the 23 Ultra is the better feature rich phone, the 8 Pro is a gaming beast.First, I tested Genshin Impact, and while it performs better on iPhone 13 Pro Max (on Medium settings), this phone plays great with MAX setting when you set the in phone game mode settings to rise and the fan is blasting. To get great gameplay without compromising resolution and frame rate AND not having your phone turn into a piece of hot coal after 20 minutes is a absolut win for me. Mapping touch screen buttons to a controller definitely is a negative, as the performance is massively noticeable, compared to iOS native controller support, but that's a small price to pay for gaming freedom. I used the GameSir X2 (Bluetooth) for every phone.As mentioned earlier, my main reason for switching is freedom, and part of that is emulation without hacking (jailbreaking) my phone. I downloaded everything from NES to GameCube, GameBoy to 3ds, and this is where the Red Magic 8 Pro 16gb version outclasses the 23 Ultra. Right of the bat, every game I tested looked and performed better.With Mario 3D Land, the 23 Ultra played decently with 2x resolution  (""chugged"" here and there) while the Red had the same performance at 4x resolution on Rise mode. Dropped it to 3x and Balanced, and it played PERFECTLY. Visually, there is almost no difference in visuals between 3x and 4x on the phone, and was only able to tell them apart when I zoomed in on the screenshots I took to compare the different resolutions (from 2x to 4x).I won't explain every test I did (which took about 3 hours), but the one that impressed me most was God of War Ghost of Sparta. I was able to play that with 10x resolution on the 8 Pro on Balance mode with as if it was running at 1x resolution, while it became almost unplayable around 6x on the 23 ultra. Those gaming features truly make a difference.As for the other basic functions, some are serviceable, some are great. Calls on speaker are lower than when music plays. The music sounds great and loud to me (better than 13 Pro Max), but calls over the speaker sound like whisper in comparison. In a quiet room, any external noise would easily down out the call. Off of speaker, it sound loud and clear.Music is awesome. Streaming through Amazon Music (cuz the stupid app won't let me download and listen on another app, nor transfer out), the phone is surprisingly loud and clear. I didn't notice any distortion or unbalancing issues with the bass, and I definitely enjoyed listening through this phone than I did on the iPhone and Samsung. The fact that it has a headphone jack may not matter if you have Bluetooth headphones, but now you can tell people to ""pass the aux cord"" XD.The camera is surprisingly nice, considering it's primarily a gaming phone. The 13 Pro Max took some great pictures and videos, and the 23 Ultra blew that out of the water, but while the Red 8 Pro can't compete with them in a side by side comparison, they look great on their own. When you inevitably take a video or picture, you WILL be satisfied and impressed with how great they came out considering photography is not why you would consider this phone over something mainstream.Last, and certainly not least; this charges FAST AS HELL! In about 5 minutes, you'll gain about 20%. In about 30 minutes, you'll go from 2% to 90%. It doesn't matter how fast this phone dies (this WILL last you all day with moderate use) if you can charge it to 100% in such a short time. Unfortunately, it doesn't have wireless charging, but with charging speeds (65w) like this, I wouldn't use it, anyway.Tl;dr:If you want the best gaming experience on your primary phone, get the 16gb Red Magic 8 Pro.","Jack of all Trades, Master of Gaming",2023-05-16,5.0,R1M2V3GDRWV7KS,Hinkydoo,9.0,"It's an excellent phone.  Coming from iphone 12 pro max this phone is superior in every way.  I am on the t mobile network already so idk about the network compatability issues which others have spoken to.I am going to explain how you turn off RTT calling though, which will make this phone incrementally better for  you and the people you call.How to turn off RTT calling:Go to SettingsMobile NetworkChange network type to ""3G""Go into your dialerGo into settingsAccessabilitiesTurn off RTTReturn to phone settingsMobile networkTurn 5g back onDonePros: The screen is excellent, the CPU is excellent, the GPU is excellent, the refresh rate is excellent, the battery life is excellent, the charging speed is extremely fast, it's light weight, asthetically pleasing, the software is excellent and I have not seen any mandarin to English translation issues, customer service is prompt and thorough.Cons: There is a serious lack of accessories in the market for this device, finding a high quality case (ie OtterBox, Pelican, Mouse, etc) is impossible, finding a real leather case is impossible, not many Android OS updates will be made available, phone and accessories are priced much lower on manufacturer website (ie ""on sale"" here is MSRP w/o markup), requires some tweaking (RTT off) to actually be a functional phone for any sort of business calls, game controller accessory doesn't seem to fully function with mobile games (PUBG only one joystick is responsive) however this could be due to the fact that idk how to set it up yet, customer service is very opaque regarding any sort of future updates or cut off for software or security updates and I find conflicting information online but again may be my own mistake.Overall it's a very very high quality phone.  The performance is like nothing I have ever seen in a mobile device.  It technically has more ram at 22gb than my Acer Predator Helios 300 which has 16 gigs of ram and a 3070 Ti that Jarod labeled an ""S class"" laptop in 2022.  I feel like this is a much more appropriate phone to pair with that laptop, the iphone 12 always seemed like it was lacking by comparison.  If you have a gaming laptop I'd suggest this phone just for the fact that it will feel more like a seamless experience with the high refresh rate and benchmark scores when you switch from your laptop to your mobile device.  The issues with accessories are a big problem though, I would really like to have an ecco leather case or something more substantial like an OtterBox on a phone like this.  I found that the magsafe environment on the iphone was convenient, but I ultimately never used the wireless charging or the magsafe charger after the first year because they were so slow compared to the wired charger, and the redmagic wire charger blows that one away by comparison.  It's also worth noting that the heat difference between this and the iphone is unbelievable, that stupid iphone was always overheating, this redmagic phone doesn't even heat up while fast charging.  The integrated fan is a very welcome trade off instead of an IPXX rating as I rarely take my electronics into the pool and I do not make tik tok videos of my phone traveling through tunnels in canals.  It would be like if the predator laptop didn't have any fans and instead I could throw it into the pool and not have to use my brain for stupid things like consequences.  I guess a dust rating might be helpful though, especially since I can't take the phone apart like I can the laptop to CLEAN the fan so it's not a fair comparison.  I use all of these devices for work too and they are all perfectly suited to that environment.  The only thing lacking from a business / functionality standpoint is the lack of an integrated stylus, but idk where they would even put one in something which I imagine must be very compact internally.  However the ability to cast to my projector via the integrated widget is an excellent trade off and the ability to connect a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse as well as a monitor and Ethernet is just on a whole other level.  I haven't tried running MS suite on this yet but I'm not worried about it.  I don't see excel slowing this thing down with pivot tables, multiple tabs, or complex equations having to load.  I have not tried the mouse and keyboard yet but I am excited to in the future and with my projector as a screen.For accessories I would suggest a carbon fiber case and glass screen protector (because I can't find anything else), with a ram mount phone holder since this does not support wireless charging.  Give the lack of a good case on the market and the delicate nature of such a powerful phone you don't want to skimp on the car mount and end up with a broken phone.  Otherwise it's a fantastic upgrade and I can't see any reason not to switch from anything else on the market.  For what it's worth t mobile has become a fantastic network after the purchase of Sprint, I have 5G almost everywhere I go and I do a lot of overlanding.",Excellent phone once you turn off RTT calling,2023-09-27,1.0

I use smart phones till they fail. In the case of the Notes, after they’ve failed several times: the Note 4 was the last Note model that was easily user serviceable.After my middle-school son had good experiences with a couple of Motorola budget phones, I had decided I’d try that brand and give up the stylus. Then my Note 4 failed with a main board problem just after the 2020 G Stylus was introduced, so I didn’t have to.Forgetting about the stylus for the moment, this is an incredible bargain for a smart phone. As far as technology’s ability to delight, it’s a great time we live in. I’m easily impressed because I’m comparing it to 4-year-old technology, but this thing is available for under $300, and for a brief while was available to new Verizon customers for $150.  That is remarkable.For that, you get great basic cell phone functionality, more than sufficient speed and storage, and okay (with hopes of better in time) stylus operation.This is the first cell phone I’ve owned that I could charge up in the morning and have last the whole day without constantly plugging it in whenever and wherever I could find an outlet. In fact, to improve battery longevity, I only charge it to 80% capacity, and it’s still enough to do that. There’s been criticism of the G Stylus’ 4000 mAh battery compared to the G Power’s 5000, but that hasn’t been a factor for me.Reception at the coast has been better than with Iphone 8 Plus and 11 Pro Max phones belonging to other family members. My phone is always the first to have a usable signal.The fingerprint security is spot on. This is not the first phone I’ve had with that feature, but it’s the first where it could be relied on.It is also absolutely wonderful to have a phone loud enough to play music or conference using speaker phone without an accessory speaker.The three cameras give a lot of options. The Iphone owners in the family are probably right that their phone cameras are better. But this is plenty good enough for me, and an improvement over anything I’ve had. I’ve even found the macro camera useful. Haven’t used the panorama camera yet.I’ve seen a couple of Youtube videos that persuade me the G Stylus will be user serviceable if/when the time comes, unlike some of the lower-end Motorolas. I’d rather not deal with adhesives at all, but I don’t think that’s a choice left to smart phone owners. If the battery or the USB port needs replacing or there’s water ingress, I could deal with that. Will parts be available as they’ve been with the Note phones? I’m not sure. Fewer G Styluses will be sold; the model life will be 12 months or so; and it’s so cheap many people will replace rather than fix a damaged phone. I have an Otterbox and sapphire glass on it, which has already survived a couple of drops on a concrete floor.After two months, the few things less than ideal are:- The display has neither the color subtlety or the ultimate brightness that Samsung OLED displays have long had. Use in bright sunlight is difficult. Elsewhere it’s just fine.- Motorola’s minimalist version of Android is mostly a plus, especially since all the Samsung bloatware isn’t present. But I do really miss organizing apps into folders. I’ll look further for a work-around.- Motorola’s stylus use doesn’t screen out palm touches as you write at the opposite side of the screen. Samsung’s implementations have done this so well and for so long that I’d never realized it was even necessary. This is really frustrating with the G Stylus. But I think it’s something Motorola could correct in software, and I hope they’ll do that.- The stylus apps Motorola supplies are limited. I installed and am happy with Microsoft OneNote instead.- I’ve mislaid the stylus a couple of times, as I did with my Samsung phones. Motorola and accessory vendors haven’t yet offered replacements.A lot of what makes me happy with the G Stylus is due to maturing technology and packaging that now allows a well-executed feature-laden budget phone. But I still give Motorola a lot of credit for doing this.",Best cell phone I've had,2020-07-26,5.0,R161LX9247KXS0,Sasha Nealand,1.0,"Works good, I'm happy with it except the charging port fails two times and needed to be replaced. The first time I had to send it in to Motorola leaving me without a phone for about a week, while I was on a trip, which was not good but at least it was covered under the Motorola 1 year warranty. Now its not covered under the warranty anymore as it is a year and a half old and Motorola wants $175 to send it in to repair a phone that costs $209 new. So I wont be doing that, not sure if I will buy a Motorola phone again as the charging port failure seems to be a common problem for their phones, although I liked everything else about the phone. The stylus was handy although it kept falling out and getting lost, I had to buy about 5-6 replacement stulus since I had this phone.",charging port failed two times,2023-03-10,3.0

But so far no issues.",Really good phone under $150,2023-09-25,4.0,R1JP7IM51TIEKQ,Ro Jo,22.0,"I currently have a Samsung Note 9, which was released in 2018 (it is relevant to this review, I promise), but I'm not happy with the direction Samsung is going with their newer higher end phones (taking away expandable storage, taking away some sensors, etc) so I was looking to get a feel for a new phone company.We currently have two TCL TV's that we love so I decided to give TCL a try. I am testing a new unlocked TCL 30XL (2022) outside on a sunny day right next to my Note 9. Right off the bat, it's very hard to see the screen on the 30XL when I'm standing in the sun and have the screen at 100% brightness. If this was the only issue, I could possibly deal with it by adjusting how I use the phone, but it's not the only issue.The biggest problem I have with this phone is my connection speed. I have made sure to adjust every setting the same that I can on the 30XL and Note 9. I even migrated all of my settings from that phone. I'm on Verizon network with what is a very good connection on the Note 9. I've tested my speed a dozen times in 6 different positions while connected to only mobile data and I'm averaging about 48 Mbps on the Note 9 and 0.02 Mbps on the 30XL! It's almost a non-existent connection. I'm swapping the sim card each time and checking the speed with the other phone as soon as I get the sim swapped while holding them in the exact same position. Both phones are 4G and say that in the bar. It has nothing to do with the sim and nothing to do with Verizon. All controllable parameters being equal, it's hard to believe that a phone 4 model years newer would run a data connection so much slower. It makes me believe there might be something wrong with this particular 30XL.The fingerprint reader is hit and miss on this phone. The speed of the phone switching from app to app is noticeably slower than the Note 9. Even typing on the phone feels a bit glitchy, like when I want to delete a couple sentences and hold down backspace/delete on my keyboard, it doesn't delete the letters and words smoothly, it doesn't feel like it can keep up and then all of a sudden it's deleted a bunch of words into the next sentence. I use the same keyboard on my Samsung, and this does not happen. I know this isn't a perfect comparison, it's what I have to work with. The perceived feel of a phone while it's processing is an important part of the overall experience.Maybe if I was able to splurge on one of TCL's higher end phones this wouldn't be an issue? I just didn't feel like I could get their higher end phone at the moment, and wanted to test out the company before potentially switching to them full time. I don't know if this phone is a lemon in more ways than just the mobile data speed?The phone does feel good in the hand, the screen size is good, and battery seems to last better than the Note 9 (which does still have it's original battery). If it wasn't for the phone feeling like it lags while processing, I'd consider getting the same replacement phone to see if the unusable mobile speeds are just a bad unit. As it is, I don't think I can try another 30XL, even for the great price.My significant other is wanting to switch from Samsung also. I was hoping I could recommend TCL, but right now I couldn't. I will have to return this phone. I'm not sure what direction to go from here, but we use our phones for so much online stuff nowadays that there's no way to keep a phone that doesn't do online stuff well, not to mention one that doesn't switch from app to app without a lag since everything is done using apps now.",I cannot recommend this phone right now.,2023-04-03,1.0

It's taking me a few days to copy over all my apps and settings (I run a lot of weird stuff apparently), so I haven't stress-tested it yet in real-life conditions.

The TCL 30 Z is the same entry-level price point, so the downgrade here is a shock.  However, if I really cared about speakers, I shouldn't have purchased this entry-level device.- Android 12 is not my bag.

Not great.Bought this for my Dad who needed to upgrade from his old Galaxy S7 Edge (also a security risk as it's no longer updated...yikes) and this was the most affordable option for him at that point in time that wasn't refurbished, used, or overpriced for what you're getting. (Man, there are a LOT of those.)Pros:-Battery life. (When you hear ""all day battery"" they ain't kiddin'. Motorolla (really Lenovo) gives you a big, beefy battery with this thing.)-USB-C. (Yay! No more having to futz around with Micro-USB.)-Fingerprint reader and face unlock.-Android 11! (I really don't like 12 and have missed 11.)-They actually give you a charger! (Take *that*, Apple!)Cons:-Performance isn't where it needs to be. (4GB of RAM sounds reasonable for Android, but it's kinda pushing it. The older 600 series Snapdragon is long in the tooth and showing its age, so it's not exactly a speed demon, itself.)-64GB of storage isn't exactly going to win any awards. (And much like any storage device with an operating system, the fuller it gets, the slower it runs. Use the Micro SD slot, people!)-Only 10w charging. (So no matter what brick you throw at it, it'll TurboCharge (their branding) but it won't be like a Google Pixel series phone, which is lightning fast by comparison.)-720p display. (Don't take that 1600 to heart, because you're not getting that. I'm not sure why they chose this display or this particular size, but it's a rough 720p as in it's barely there, but there nonetheless.)-Camera notch IN the display. (Not a cut-out, not at the top of the bezel, no. Smack-dab right in the screen (much like the Pixel 4/4a, onward.)-Screen is polarized. (If you wear certain sunglasses, you can't rotate this to landscape mode as you won't be able to see the screen. It's LCD and probably akin to a Nintendo Gameboy Color, but much better quality.)Overall thoughts:I can see why people had problems getting their Verizon service to work with this phone. I got it to work with a simple SIM swap but the texting was a pain as their texting services are now secured and this didn't secure them right out of the box. (I forget the setting, but it's in the Hamburger Bar settings menu, it's per user and not overall. It's a pain to work with, but it does work.) Phone calls and everything else (including E-911) work well, after finagling. So does Wifi calling. It's just a needless pain to set up, really.The performance is okay, good even, if you let the AI in the phone follow what you do. (Sounds like a security risk, but it's actually a caching mechanism allowing the phone to know what you use the most and giving it priority over everything else.) Kinda like how you can use Optane memory in an Intel-based computer to speed up a HDD akin to using a Hybrid drive. (In its current form/update, the phone reminds me of a Pixel 2 in overall power.)The screen could be better. You can see the individual pixels and the lines/rows they're in and they're so noticeable that you can actually be taken out of the moment with what you're watching/seeing when it happens. It is capable of displaying 1440p and 4k signals, still at 720p, but usually devices with smaller resolution screens get stuck at 480p or 720p signals and make the best of it while this can successfully take in those signals and at least cleans up the picture and makes it look like proper HD, even though it's at the low end of it. Buffering isn't nearly as bad because it's driving a 720p display, so movies and shows will load slightly faster because of it. (Within in reason. Some apps drag like they're being operated by snails until the stream fully loads. Ugh.)The lack of stereo speakers is a real pain. (I miss my Pixel for that alone.)I traded my Dad my phone (Pixel 4a) for his (this one) because I can use it better (this is a MASSIVE phone) and the Pixel works better for him. This is capable enough for most people and it's quite usable. The hotspot feature works (you have to have a subscription with your carrier to use it), it works with Android Auto (very sluggish start up time...bleh), and for A/V stuff, it works well enough.For the price? Solid phone. Especially when you consider it's brand new and not used or refurbished. That said, if you're fine with used/refurbished and want something with more power in the same price range, I recommend a Pixel 4a or 5/5a. Both will still be supported with updates through 2023 (possibly 2024) and have a solid feature set, whereas this will be using Android 11 for the foreseeable future (but with security updates!) and if you want Android 13 and beyond, you'll need a better/newer phone.I'm honestly more or less happy with it, the price was good for what you're getting (brand new), and it's a sturdy beast with a massive battery (by comparison). Recommended.UPDATE: Changing my final thought to mildly recommended. The phone still works, but the AI garbage is nothing but a sales pitch. The phone somehow seems to go slower, with some new feature or task you give it. The AI is supposed to be helping it learn which apps you use the most and adjusts itself accordingly. Well, the AI decided ""I'm going to use the slowest lane possible. We'll get there in 2 hours, instead of 30 minutes. Enjoy the ride!"" and boy, oh boy, does it crawl.It's gotten to the point where using Android Auto is just almost completely impossible. Button presses/taps can take upwards of 30-60 seconds to register! (That's insane when you're supposed to be using it as a GPS!) YouTube music lost most of my songs and refused to play them, asking me to redownload them (and it never did), so there would be entire skip spots during any journey. (I had to pull over once to figure out what the heck was going on.)Voice commands are sluggish, reaction times are the equivalent of a newbie going up against Tyson in his prime. You take the swing, but nothing happens until after you needed it many seconds ago.Even outside of Android Auto, it's sluggish. Loading Chrome can be a nightmare, given the page you're checking out. *sigh*Part of the problem is the storage. Much like on a computer, eMMC (which is what a phone uses) can slow down once it's too full, and all storage drives (regardless of the type) all have a recommendation of keeping things at, or below, 50% of the storage. Well, that's impossible on this phone because nothing will install to the SD card and the Motorola bloatware takes up a good chunk of your available space. You can max out the storage on this thing in no time flat.It's a great starter phone, it's fine if you're needing one in a pinch and can't afford more (believe me, I get it, I've been there more times than I can count.), but it's not going to be your #1 daily driver in the long run. Not unless you're fine with Motorola apps, chrome, some texting, and maybe some YouTube. Forget Android Auto, forget gaming, and forget packing a bunch of apps on here. It's clearly just a phone in a pretty Android wrapper.","A Beast Of A Battery, Not Such A Beast Of Performance",2022-06-26,3.0

I'd rather have an Umidigi than a $1200 flagship phone.  Look at it this way, if you lose it, or break it, or it gets stolen, or it breaks out of warranty, you're out $100-300 bucks depending on the model you bought.  I hate investing such a large sum of money in an item that can easily be stolen, lost or quit working.  I have the money to do so, but I'd rather invest that money or spend it elsewhere.  The one problem with this phone is it's WEIGHT!  Most likely due to the battery size.  I'd rather have the battery last less and have a lighter phone than have such a heavy phone with a long lasting battery.  SOme people may like the trade-off.  The phone is built superior to flagship $1200+ phones.  Durable, drop proof, waterproof.  What more can you ask for.  I HATE CASES, due to my OCD; stuff and dirt and skin oils get in crevices and under the case and I freak out!  Buying a durable IP68/69 miltiary-grade phone such as the Bison eliminates the need for a case.  I'm still afraid to drop the phone because it's so heavy!  But it could handle it.  I bought this phone on sale for $89.99 after the $20.00 coupon.  I could not complain!  If it lasts 6 months it's worth the money spent.  Absolutely AMAZING phone.

I upgraded from a Galaxy S20, so some of my comments will include that comparison.Pros:-MicroSD support! This is a requirement for me, and why I didn't really consider the S21 or S22.-Headphone jack! I missed it on the S20.-Replaceable battery! I hadn't had that since the LG G3.-Notification LED! I can't say I was conscious of missing it, and wasn't sure I'd use it. But it's nice to be able to see charge status or if I have a new notification from across the room.-Rugged, grippy build, with IP68. I actually like the plastic; I don't get the trend of slippery, fingerprint-magnet glass sandwiches (like the S20).-Very fast and reliable side-mounted fingerprint sensor. I hate the trend of in-display fingerprint sensors that are slow, unreliable, and leave a smudge on the screen. (The S20 is horrible about this.)-Gorilla Glass Victus+ for the display. It also has an excellent oleophobic coating - doesn't easily get smeared.-Snappy, smooth performance with the efficient Snapdragon 778G. Gets warm occasionally but not hot and doesn't throttle. I don't notice a performance difference compared to a flagship (but then I don't do benchmarks or heavy gaming). (The S20 got really hot and throttled.)-USB 3 with video out and Samsung Dex support. USB video out often isn't listed on specs sheets, but it's usually only on flagships, so it's nice to have it here.-Great battery life. I can easily get 2+ days despite the not-huge battery (4050 mAh).-The Wifi and LTE range and speed are noticeably better than on my S20! (My rural Verizon-partner carrier does not have 5G so I can't comment on that.)-Extra assignable keys-Reasonable price-Software support equivalent to flagships (month security updates,, 4 Android updates, 5 years of security updates)-Clear, sharp display without PWM according to notebookcheck - PWM is a dimming method that uses flicker. OLEDs and some LCDs use it - this doesn't - no flicker! So it's easier on the eyes than OLED if you're flicker-sensitive. I find it to be bright enough.Cons:-It is a rather big and heavy phone. Think S22 Ultra with a rugged case.-The display is LCD, not AMOLED, and according to notebookcheck, the color accuracy isn't great. I admit that the colors aren't as vibrant as AMOLED - they don't ""pop"" as much. But I like the display anyway, and as noted above, it's sharp and clear and without PWM.-Being LCD, there's also no Always-On Display. I adjusted by turning on Lift to Wake, plus the notification LED and really fast fingerprint sensor help.-It has a notch for the front camera. It's a small waterdrop notch, but it's still my first phone with a notch and I don't love it. With the big bezels Samsung could have put the camera in the bezel instead.-Big bezels (but I don't care).-According the specs the cameras aren't as good as on a flagship. But they're good enough for me.-Slow charging. 15W ""Fast Charging"" was fast 5 years ago with much smaller batteries. At least battery life is good, and charging doesn't make the phone hot, and the battery is changeable.-The built-in mono audio is okay, but certainly not premium. Still, I can hear and be heard clearly and the volume is fine. The S20 certainly has better audio. But my friend said he could hear me better when I was on the XCover6 than on the S20, so maybe it has a better mic. Or maybe it was the better Wifi performance.Other notes:This model - SM-G736U1, USA Unlocked - is not identical to the European models reviewed on notebookcheck and YouTube, or the specs listed on GSMArena. The network bands supported are different. Also, some reviewed models have dual SIM slots plus dedicated MicroSD. This model does not. It has one SIM slot, one MicroSD slot, and supports e-SIM.-It's hard to find a network bands list for the USA Unlocked model. I can confirm that it supports LTE Band 13, required for Verizon and Verizon partner support. I had to check this because a lot of Samsung Unlocked devices - like the A53 - do not support Band 13. My rural Verizon partner requires B13 and it works great. No 5G is available in my area so I don't know what it supports there.That's a lot, hope it's helpful.

WhatsApp supports calling, texting, voice messages, emoji, etc. I have not been able to test the calling through WhatsApp but my friend told me the audio sounds really good when I sent them a voice message.This phone is used to take a break from my smartphone during the day and to have some peace of mind. It is very freeing to just take my Nokia 6300 4G with me and have no additional distractions or mindless scrolling.The battery life seems to last a little over 24 hours with light usage. Don’t expect to take pictures with the 3MP camera but it does have a QR scanner app if needed. As far as group text messaging goes, it DOES work but you have to kind of “cheat” the system to do so. When sending messages in the group sms chat, you have to add a subject line to each message before sending it otherwise it will send the message individually to each group member and can be really annoying. Just know that it DOES work if needed.I have heard of issues regarding the phone having “double typing” issues. So far the buttons are working fine however I am a little concerned regarding the power button located at the top of the phone. I am scared it will easily be pushed in and will no longer work. That’s how delicate that little button feels to me. Maybe I’m exaggerating, I’m not sure but that’s something I try to be mindful and careful of each time I use the phone because it seems to be the only way to turn the screen on manually since it’s the phone’s way of locking and protecting from any butt dialing.If you’re looking for a feature phone with group sms messaging (with the subject line work around), WhatsApp, and a HotSpot feature, I highly recommend this phone. Time to ditch your smartphone and be more involved in the moment! ^_^",Nokia 6300 4G is A Decent Smartphone Replacement,2023-05-23,4.0,R1CVM55PAOB062,Matthew,23.0,"The BuildI can’t speak in comparison to old Nokia devices built by Nokia, but I find the build pretty nice. It is matte plastic with glossy sides. Upon unboxing, I noticed the sides were a little smudged from what I would assume was it sliding around in the plastic baggy. 99% of the smudges came out but I did notice some imperfections on the frame. It was nothing that bothered me but something to point out. About a few days in, the frame picked up some scratches. If you’re one to like your device to stay in mint Condition, I would recommend getting a case. A few people on here have said good things about the few limited ones out there. I’m not a big fan of the buttons being on the glossy screen part of the device. You cannot keep this device clean. The buttons trap a lot of stuff and you’d need to spend a long time cleaning that to get it clean. If you tap the phone, you can hear a spring sound. Something I noticed a little while holding the device and moving it around, but I am super sensitive to sound. The first day with the device, my “OK” button squeaked when touching and pushing it. This went away the next day after some use. The screen has poor viewing angles but you can read texts and whatnot just fine. There are no volume buttons on this device and you control the volume via KaiOS and the d-pad. I picked the cyan green color and I love this color a lot!Battery Life/Charge TimeI found battery life to be just a little better than smartphones. This must be because of KaiOS and how dumber phones don’t have an OS this modern. With 5 charge cycles and around 2h screen time (no app use just call/text), 100% to charge warning (15%) lasted about 3 days on average. Charge time with the Nokia charger took ~2.5 hours to get from 15% to 100%. You could get a faster charge with a different charging setup but the included charger is nice for travel.The KeyboardWith this being the first device I’ve used with a button layout like this, it took some time to get used to. After a few days, I was able to type faster and now I’m pretty good understanding the layout. I do wish the buttons were separated a little or raised so they were easier to press and feel for. I make some accidental presses with it but overtime I learned how to adjust my typing with it. Prediction is pretty good but you do need to switch to it every time you enter a text field. Slight issue but something you’d get used to. You're able to set your own predictive words which will be used first while typing the key combination, but I haven't found a way to reset this without turning off predictive text and back on. Google assistant voice-to-text is accurate but is a bit slow and doesn’t always hear you right. Assistant on android and other products seems to be better so this might be due to the slower hardware on the Nokia. All of the buttons on the device are clicky and have a nice feel.The CameraIt’s a .2MP camera with flash so there’s not much to say about it. More so there for emergency purposes. Wish it had a better one, at least 2MP to match the original 6300.Call QualityNo issues here while in a pretty covered T-Mobile area. Calls on Wi-Fi sound clear and the caller has no problem hearing me. I think it has a great mic and ear piece for the price.Thoughts on KaiOS 2.5.4I’m not using the OS to its full potential by using apps and whatnot. I got this phone for a detox and just use text/call. For this purpose, I really like KaiOS! I like the ability to download and use apps if necessary. I don’t use google maps on this device but you have the ability to use it. I hear the location isn’t too accurate though. You're able to select your current location if you find the auto location to be bad/don't want location tracking on. YouTube is available and cannot be deleted. Facebook and WhatsApp can be deleted. WhatsApp allows for voice calls now if you need that. The app selection is limited but you are using an OS based off HTML and Firefox. Yes, it’s not perfect but it has potential to be something big. KaiOS isn’t organized that well and it does take some time to find out how to do things. For the longest time, I didn’t think you were able to leave a call to go into messages but pressing option while in a call, there is an option to open messages. Predictive text should stick but since its not perfect, I don’t mind having to switch to it when needed. It is a little sluggish but I think that’s expected coming from an iPhone more powerful than my 2016 MacBook Pro. Apps quit after leaving them. I haven’t noticed any horrible issues - like the contacts bricking issue. I recommend using the memory cleaner every few days. I personally run it before I put it on the charger.Contacts TipI’ve noticed on Reddit that sometimes the KaiOS contacts app will brick and not work. I’m not sure if this is due to google contacts syncing, but you’re able to disable sync every time you open contacts in the contacts settings. To possibly bypass this issue later on, I exported my google contacts to the SD card in the device, removed my google account and imported the contacts. Contacts may brick for me later but crossing my fingers that this is a work around for the sync issue.MMS TipI heard group texts on the device sends out texts to each individual contact. If you add a subject line so it converts to MMS, it'll send in the group chat.Final Thoughts/Am I Keeping the 6300 4G?The Nokia 6300 4G is a great phone to get into a dumb phone detox for $69. I haven’t run into any major issues with the OS just yet and based off my usage, I would recommend getting this phone. I got this for a 30 day experiment but the phone is going to become my new daily driver while I use my old iPhone for offline GPS/music. Thinking about getting a Garmin GPS and an older iPod touch so I’m able to listen to music on a light small device, not a 6.5” iPhone.",In-Depth Review of the Nokia 6300 4G,2022-02-25,3.0

My original review is below this update. After several emails back and forth with the seller, I was able to exchange the phone and received a replacement within a day or two. I've been using the replacement phone for a few weeks now and it appears to be working just fine. I'm not sure if maybe I had just received a ""lemon"" or if my issues are more common. I recall reading some other reviews that state that the phone relies too much on Wifi calling and also another review that said something about people on the other end of the call not able to hear you. Both of those reviews are symptoms of what I was going through with the first phone they sent me. My advice would be to make sure Wifi calling is turned off and make several calls to make sure that the other person can hear you. The phone always sounded good on my end, so it was hard to know that there was a problem until the friend I was calling told me about it. If you experience any of those issues, it's a possibility that your phone is afflicted with the same problem and you should contact the seller. (End of updated review).Overall, I really want to like this phone, but one issue stands in the way. This phone is bound and determined to use Wifi calling, even while Wifi calling is turned off. Wifi calling is not reliable at all (which isn't normally a big deal since you can ordinarily just disable that feature) however this phone will pick up any saved/open Wifi network during the middle of a call which makes it impossible for the party on the other end to hear me. Not good for business. Driving down the highway, trying to do business over the phone and if you happen to be passing businesses with open networks, well you can kiss your customers goodbye. What makes it even worse, I've contacted the seller twice about this issue with no response. As I said, I really wanted to like this phone but the issue with the calls along with absolutely no customer service, makes this a 2 star review.","*Updated review* Everything is great, except if you intend to make a phone call.",2022-01-06,4.0,R16SXBNDSI7WRI,Thom,17.0,"UPDATED: Below is my original review. My review includes my personal opinions. Decide for yourself if any of my issues are worth your decision to purchase. *And note the NO Refunds/Returns on this phone* My update is to let the reader know I was offered 4 different payout options to delete my comment and review. Starting at $20 and going up to $50 when I didn't respond. They said they changed manufacturing to improve my concerns. Which is great, but I will not be bribed to change an honest review if it may affect your decision to purchase. I told them I would be happy to provide an updated review with an updated phone to review. I will reiterate from My review, the phone is not overall bad. It just doesn't meet my standards. I would've appreciated the opportunity to read an honest review like this to make my decision. Some of you may still buy this phone, and that is good for you and them! (Although, check the actual website for the phone,I think it's cheaper there) Just do your research and decide for yourself.LAST UPDATE: multimedia/group messages don't download well on wifi. Doesn't come with headphones, which isn't major, I just miss new headphones with the purchase of a new phone.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'll start with the positive that the camera is a lot better than my previous phone (may or may not be best, but all I needed) as well as the screen resolution. Two factors that led me to purchase the phone. It seems to run fairly fast and seems durable. I've had a few people say it's too heavy, but I haven't really noticed. The shortcut buttons are good, but not necessarily in the best location. And in addition, the power and volume buttons all being on the same side are not ideal. Maybe just takes time to get used to.I didn't realize(possibly my lack of research which I thought I did plenty of) it was so reliant on Google. You can't uninstall any of the Google features and the Google Search widget is permanently on the home screen.It seems really glitchy. Several apps will pause and then close out randomly.The wifi calling is horrendous/awful and any worse word you can describe it. I need the wifi calling because my service can be spotty in my facility. It sounds gargled, sometimes even robotic every other word, and will drop frequently.Battery life is sufficient, but I wish I would've selected one with longer power. I can make it through about a day and a half, which I guess is right on with how much I use it. The charging seems to be really slow too.I'm debating returning it... I wouldn't necessarily recommend unless the camera and screen resolution are the only things you need to improve in your phone status.O, the thermometer is cool, but never use it...",Too reliant on Google/horrendous wifi calling,2021-12-03,2.0

For a spare phone, a phone for your parents who aren’t used to technology, or even a kids first phone this will work for you.  The phone is reasonably responsive I didn’t feel like it was stuttering while using it.  Now while this it not a phone worth 1k or more there are a lot of things going for it. The battery is huge and lasts for days on end as a simple user for messages, web browsing, etc.  now I would not recommend this to the heavy user for gaming and other things.  But for what you’re paying this phone is a good grab. I’d highly recommend this phone for the quality and price you are paying plus you even get a screen protector and a case included and installed. No having to fuss over going out to purchase those right away or raven worrying if the screen protector will go on correctly. This phone is a must if you just need something cheap and reasonable for you to use daily for a little while.  I’m not sure how the support would go for this over time but already having android 13is great with the new customization options and full features from android it’s a great grab for someone not looking to break the bank. While this phone doesn’t compete with high end models you are getting a way bigger battery for the phone and pretty much the same software features if you’re looking for a phone to play the newest games or take the best pictures I’d say this isn’t for you and spend more money on a different phone but if you need a phone just for daily use calling text and the basics this could be the one for a small price.",Great budget phone!,2023-07-24,4.0,R16KA8PTTZPBZB,johnp2,4.0,"Long time Umidigi user.

(Opinions on screens and keyboards tend to vary widely - what suits me perfectly may seem to be junk to you, so YMMV).The speakers on the front underside - the sound is O.K. (for an inexpensive laptop) but volume is lacking.Power supplied through a proprietary Acer plug, not through a USB-C port.  Cord can only attach to the laptop on the left side (as seen by the user at the keyboard).Windows ""S"" is installed; it is limited to running apps available only in the Microsoft Store.Suggested upgrade - move up to Windows 10 Home.  It's a free upgrade - with the caveat that you cannot return to ""S"" version.To upgrade to Home version (instructions as of the date of this review; I assume/accept no responsibility if things go awry.  You may want to Google instructions to verify):Go to Settings.Then select Update & Security.In the left sidebar, click Activation.Then click “Go to the Store.”Press the “Get” button under the “Switch out of S Mode” section and in a very short time you'll be assigned the Windows Home version.Suggested upgrade - if you want to encrypt your laptop you may want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise.  These upgrades are not free, check Microsoft for current pricing.The Aspire 5 has a TPM chip so encryption will not require a boot password (not your Windows password).If you want to set a boot password for the computer (not your Windows password) you can set that in BIOS.  Don't forget it - resetting a boot password on a laptop can be a pain and a half (or impossible) to rectify.  See below on how to get into BIOS.The included 128GB PCIe NVMe SSD drive is (for me) large enough to hold Windows 10 Enterprise and the applications I use and is quick enough to run them. I'm in I.T. support (although semi-retired) and don't use the Aspire 5 for computer games. YMMV.Suggested upgrade - add an additional SSD to the computer (screws are in the box, housing and cable required are inside the Aspire 5).  You can Google videos on how to perform the upgrade.  A second internal drive allows you to separate your data from your operating system and applications; if Windows ever has to be completely re-installed your data won't be affected.  If you keep your data in the Cloud you can set the second drive as the sync drive and not fill up “C:” drive.The chip, an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, does pretty well for my purposes.  Again, gamers may have a different opinion so YMMV. I've had no issues when viewing training or YouTube videos.The battery life won't get me through a typical support day without at least some recharge time - Acer claims up to 7 1/2 hours but, of course, that depends on what you're doing.  Watching videos will eat more power than writing a project proposal in Word.  YMMV, but I bought a second power cord to take with me to client offices while leaving the cord  at my home office plugged in. I seem to be getting 5 hours, maybe a bit better, with the screen set to maximum brightness.The machine doesn't get overly warm in use (again, I'm not a gamer), but I use a laptop board most of the time when the laptop isn't on a hard surface, so there is nearly always some airflow under the machine.The included 4gb of included RAM is really the absolute minimum to think about with Windows 10.Suggested upgrade - add a single 4gb RAM chip in the empty slot (Google for videos on that) to bring the total to 8gb RAM. After installing the additional 4gb the computer will report 8gb installed with ""5.94gb usable"".  The 'missing' RAM is being commandeered by the Radeon software for the display.  If you need/want more the machine can support up to 32gb (1 16gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed).  16gb would require 1 8gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed.  For business purposes (Office, Chrome and You Tube videos) I'm finding the 8gb (5.94 available) to be acceptable.  YMMV.How 'easy' the RAM and hard drive upgrades are depends on how comfortable you are working with computers.  I found them quite simple.  Be careful not to crack the plastic housing when removing the bottom cover.  Using the correct plastic spudge is helpful, you can search Amazon for a selection of tools. (spudge = type of plastic or rubber pry bar).  Google the ‘how-to’ videos first.""Bloatware"" included with the computer isn't completely over-the-top, but it does take a few minutes to delete all of the junk.  The ""Microsoft Office"" included with the Aspire 5 is a 30-day trial version, not a full license.After uninstalling the bloatware I installed Microsoft Office365 with Access, Adobe Photoshop Elements, DIA (a program for diagramming), AllwaySync (a backup program), Google Chrome, Splashtop Business and Personal (remote access software), VLC Media Player and a couple of network utility applications.  I have 78gb of free space left on ""C"" drive.The three small stickers showing Ryzen chip, Aspire 5 inclusions, and Radeon graphic chip that are stuck onto the hand rest part of the computer can be easily peeled off and leave no residue (I was able to rub the remaining adhesive off easily with my thumb).  I don't know why the stickers are there - presumably if you've bought the machine you know what the details are without seeing sticky notes on the keyboard surface.  If they're for advertising purposes in the store it might be more cost effective to print advertising to be placed by the machine rather than label every machine on the production line.  I also found the ""Full 1080 HD"" sticker on the screen bezel easy to take off.  So I did.  If Acer is interested in putting relevant data on stickers, how about putting the Make, Exact Model Number, Serial Number, and Date of Manufacture on a sticker?  THAT one I would leave in place.  As it is you need to flip the machine upside down to see the manufacturer's information.  (Sorry - this is a pet peeve of mine).A couple of quick notes for those who are new to Windows laptops - if the keyboard fails to light up, check the F8 key - it can toggle the light on/off.  If you suddenly lose your WiFi connection check the F2 key - that toggles ""Airplane Mode"" on/off.  Note that the ""function"" keys are set to use the little icons (F1 is sleep, F9 is mute, etc.).  To use them as traditional function keys you need to hold down the ""Fn"" key simultaneously.  Fn+F9, for instance, will cause the Outlook application to re-sync when you've got that desktop app open.  If you prefer the traditional function key usage (not having to hold down the Fn key to use the keys within applications) you can toggle that in BIOS.  To get into BIOS, reboot the computer and immediately start tapping the F2 key (no Fn key required).For me the 'sweet spot' of laptops is in the 14"" range (11"" for road trips).  That being acknowledged I don't find the extra width or weight of the Aspire 5 to be onerous - the thin screen bezel allows the claim to the 15.6"" screen while not unduly expanding the overall size of the laptop.  At nearly 4 pounds it's a bit heavier than the under-three-pounds-sweetness that I prefer but it's not too bad.  Especially after removing the weight of those ridiculous stickers.  YMMV.If you need more power than this machine has, Acer does offer a similar package with upgrades to the Ryzen 5 chip, 8gb of RAM, and 250gb of hard drive space as well as some other goodies:https://www.amazon.com/Acer-A515-44-R41B-Hexa-Core-Processor-Graphics-dp-B087N4ZRXV/dp/B087N4ZRXV/ref=dp_ob_title_ceHTHRegards,Jim",Better with a couple of upgrades but works OK out of the box,2020-12-02,5.0,RVIKFNTNS9RAD,Austin,92.0,"Okay, so full disclosure.  I'm a computer repair technician and I bought the base model (Ryzen 3 w/4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD).  As a technician (meaning someone who can upgrade and repair computers), I'd give this a 3.5/5.  As an end user however, I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for.  It's woefully underpowered and comes with a crippled OS.  If you don't mind those things then there are a lot of cheaper options.  If you DO mind those things then I hope you know what you're doing because it's going to take a LOT of time and effort to get this thing usable.First off, S mode.  It's basically a Chromebook in S mode.  Again, you can get a Chromebook (or even another S mode device) for much cheaper than this so I don't know why you'd choose this one.  Putting that aside however, most people say that you can just get out of S mode and you'll have a normal computer, right?  Well, in THEORY that's true.  In practice however, Windows 10S likes to randomly and inexplicably revert to S mode without warning.  As a technician I see these S mode computers all the time that have reverted back to S mode with no way to go back to Windows 10 Home except to do a complete wipe and reload of the OS.  If you want to PERMANENTLY get out of S Mode, you have to get out of S mode, then download a copy of Windows 10 from the Microsoft website and make a USB flash drive with Windows 10.  Then you have to open up the flash drive, go into the Sources folder and add an ei.cfg file with the following parameters:[EditionID]Home[Channel]RetailOnce you do that you can boot from the flash drive, erase the drive, and install Windows 10 Home from scratch.  If you don't add the ei.cfg file it will just reinstall Windows 10S again.  This is not something a normal end user would be able to do, but it's necessary if you want to be able to feel secure that the thing isn't going to just randomly revert back to S mode and become unusable.Secondly, the specs.  4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD?  Seriously, Acer?  The last time 4GB of RAM was standard on laptops was like 2012.  I could see if this were a $150 computer, but at $366 it should have at LEAST 8GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD.  I upgraded mine to 8GB of RAM, a 500GB NVMe SSD, and a 2TB 2.5"" hard drive.  It's been close to a decade since I've personally owned a computer with a hard drive but it's nice to have that ability.  I also appreciate the fact that they include the mounting hardware and even the screws in a separate bag.Third, the screen.  The screen is okay, but there's a major flaw that took me a while to figure out.  The screen will dim if you unplug the charger and run it on battery.  That's normal, right?  Well what's NOT normal is that AMD has a setting called ""Vari-Bright.""  If this is turned on and you unplug the computer, the display doesn't just dim but it also loses contrast/color.  It's hard to describe it but it looks like crap.  Unfortunately the AMD Radeon software doesn't get installed through Windows Update and it's not on Acer's website so you have to go directly to AMD in order to download it.  Unfortunately that also means that AMD is going to install the latest drivers on your device, which haven't been tested and certified compatible by Acer.  Chances are it will be fine, but it's always best to use the latest driver from the computer manufacturer (in this case, Acer) rather than going to the chip manufacturer.  There are a million and one potential compatibility problems with new drivers, which is why they need to be tested by the manufacturer, who may update other drivers to compensate.  This isn't possible if you want to turn off ""Vari-Bright"" because you're forced to install the latest drivers from AMD.The next problem is with the keyboard backlight.  It turns off after 30 seconds and it won't turn back on again if you move the mouse.  You MUST touch a key on the keyboard to turn it on again.  There's a setting in the BIOS to disable the keyboard backlight timeout, but it doesn't have any effect.  Speaking of which, this computer shipped with an older BIOS revision (1.10).  I upgraded to the latest BIOS revision (1.11) but it didn't fix the keyboard backlight timeout problem.  Looking online it seems that a LOT of people are having this problem and not only with this model of Acer.  Apparently, Acer doesn't care about this problem.  I almost want to return it for this reason, but I really need another computer so I guess I'll keep it.  If I hadn't been able to resolve the screen brightness problem this would have been going back.The final issue is the battery life.  If all you're doing is reading articles this MIGHT be able to get you 4 hours of battery life.  If you're watching videos or you have a lot of stuff open, you'll be lucky to get 2-3 hours.  I mean, all manufactures overestimate their battery life to make their products look good, but this laptop doesn't last much longer than my 10 year old HP.In conclusion, I stand by my initial statement.  I truly don't know who this computer is for.  If you add the cost of the base computer ($366), plus the 500GB SSD ($60), the RAM ($45), and the 2TB hard drive ($80), you're left with a total cost of $551, and there are a lot better computers out there at that price point.  There's an 11th gen i5 15"" HP laptop on here for $599 with over TWICE the processing power, a 250GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM.  It also has space for a secondary hard drive if you need to upgrade that in the future.  If you're okay with an underpowered laptop (4GB RAM, small SSD) with a crippled OS (Windows 10S) you can get one for $150 and save yourself $200.I mean, I wouldn't call this thing a ""nice"" laptop.  It only has a single USB 3 port (the other two, including the one on the RIGHT side are USB 2.0 - that's right, a technology that debut in April of 2000 which means it's even older than Windows XP!).  It feels cheap/flimsy.  Battery life is mediocre.  It's basically a disposable laptop at a non-disposable price.  If this laptop was $150 - $200 I wouldn't be so critical of it, but whether you're looking for a cheap Chromebook type laptop or you want a real laptop that you can upgrade yourself, you can do so much better by going with something else.  I'm only keeping it because I've put so much time and effort into it and it's easier than returning it and starting over.The only person I can see that this would be suited for would be someone with a very limited budget that wants to be able to upgrade it over time vs. spending the $550 upfront.  But if they knew how to do all this computer stuff, chances are they'd have a better income and therefore a higher budget.  Maybe a student or someone just entering the workforce?  I dunno.I must say though, I'm really liking having a secondary drive in a laptop again.  It helps if I need to wipe it out because I don't have to worry about backing up the data since it's on the second hard drive.  But again, there are other computers with this capability.  If you can afford it, the $599 HP with the 11th gen i5 is a great buy.  I haven't personally purchased that computer but after doing all this, I wish I had.",I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for,2021-02-16,1.0

So far I am overall happy with this unit. The screen quality is very good for a lower to mid budget laptop and colors are vibrant enough. Touchscreen works great as well. I like the idea of the flexibility of changing between laptop mode and tablet mode. The 16"" screen size in tablet mode is great for watching movies and other random entertaining things, but if your goal is to use it for note taking or similar, it is a little on the larger side and would recommend the 14"" instead.  My main purpose is to use it for travels and remote work via remote desktop, so the additional real estate on the screen was important for me for my engineering work (CAD and programming).Since I also have a need for multiple monitors when stationary, I went ahead and also purchased a cheap off-brand USB-C docking station from Falwedi on Amazon. I was able to expand to at least 2 additional monitors, resulting in a triple monitor setup, one 24"" Dell 1080 and another 27"" Dell 2K. I did however get some issues where the external monitors would blank for a second or two occasionally, but not yet sure if this was due to the current drivers on the Ideapad or the off-brand docking station. Something I will need to investigate further at a later time.Sound quality from the speakers is just ok. There is no base, which I wouldn't expect from a lower budget laptop anyways. The camera worked decently and clear, which is sufficient for most video conferences anyways.The fingerprint reader works flawlessly and makes login into Windows and other biometric supporting apps super easy.I am however surprised on how heavy this unit is for being a new modern 16"" model. Reminds me of my 10+ year old Toshiba brick. Another drawback is that the pen or stylus was not included with it and is sold separately.There is no ethernet port and for those that want to utilize wired connections, will need to purchase an additional dongle.",Little on the heavy side but good otherwise,2023-07-21,4.0,R26JLCYDB9ADUG,Glen Jones,12.0,"So the computer itself looks nice.

And I didn’t do anything overnight with, so I’m questioning where the power went to? So as I said, it has a fingerprint reader, but every time I turn it on spin, asking me to enter a pin number or password. If I have a fingerprint reader, that should be one of the options initially. I did set it up with my fingerprint before going through all that other things about the password. It’s a good enough computer. It just has some quirks. And all the time is asking me to put in a McAfee subscription or to buy one. I can’t tell you how many fake emails I get every day about some McAfee subscription or some Norton thing I don’t really know who to trust.  So that’s kind of annoying.

Although the product has some positive aspects, there are areas that require attention for a more satisfying user experience.CPU Performance and Chrome Usage:One significant concern is the laptop's CPU usage when running resource-intensive tasks, such as opening/closing applications and heavily utilizing Chrome browser. As a power user who frequently works with multiple Chrome windows open simultaneously, I noticed that the CPU operates at 100% capacity, leading to potential performance bottlenecks. For users with less demanding tasks, this may not be a problem, but if you require better CPU performance for your tasks, you might want to consider other options.Mousepad Sensitivity:Another minor issue I encountered is the mousepad sensitivity when holding the laptop with one hand. The mousepad tends to get stuck, which appears to be related to the material and design of the laptop. While not a critical flaw, it's worth noting for potential buyers who value solid construction.Positive Aspects:Aside from the mentioned issues, there are several positive aspects to this laptop that I appreciate.

I could have spent a little extra to get a larger screen but I said ""There can't be much of a noticable difference."" That is beyond an understatement, it is far too tiny for me and I am likely going to return it so that I can get a much larger screen that I can actually see. If you have really good vision (20/20 or 20/15) this would be an affordable option for you. It's not a bad laptop for simple tasks such as icollege, surfing the web, streaming movies via hdmi to your tv and etc. The only downside to this laptop (which is an obvious one based on the dimensions) is the fact that the screen is too small. It's slim and lightweight design is actuallya plus. If it had a 15.6 inch screen like the hp 15 witht he same slim design it would be arguably one of the best laptops I've owned. I just have poor vision and cannot strain to see the screen. So I will likely be returning this laptop later this week. It came packaged really well, was already charged a bit, and seems to hold power pretty well. I'm honestly going to give it a few days to see if my eyes can adjust but.... more than likely I will be returning it to purchase a 15.6 inch screen laptop. I don't care about the processor and stuff like that because I already have a pc with super crazy specs for gaming. I just need a reasonably sized screen.Update: I decided to keep the item and give it a try. It's actually quite the bang for the buck! I decided to update it from 3 to 4 stars simply because it is very portable, fast enough to do school work and surf the web and the design isn't that bad. I don't believe that it is a 5 star item in comparison to other options, but it is definitely not a 3 star item either. Plus, it arrive on time right when I needed it. If I decide to upgrade to a different computer I will give this one to a relative. However, I actually like this product. If you decide to buy this item give it a chance to see if it's what you want. You might end up liking it too.",Do not downgrade from an Hp 15....,2021-03-06,4.0,RKDFLVT89OLM5,Jessica,0.0,It’s slow and just overall not great.

It seems with all the things coming up 32 might be necessary to run all we like to do  Cannot add more Ram, can add/upgrade the hard drive.Very QuietKeys fabulousTouchpad -- large but really nice (and I hate touchpads ... I use my Wacom Graphics Tablet. )Battery respectable; however, it depends on if you use 120 hz or 60 hz, and what all you are doing.  It can last a long time for normal texting and surfing etc., but if working, it goes fairly fast.  You therefore need to keep a charging port open to use to charge.  With no separate battery, it uses the connections leaving you with what is left for your devices  Then you have left a C and a USB 3.2, HDMI.  I don't use HDMI but might for a second display, but with my Wacom needing usb 3.2, my 2 external hard drives also need one 3.2 and one C.  I work on graphics, photos, etc., all day, and need those back ups.  For me it is critical to get the Anker Prime 6-in-1 USB C Charging Station, 140W Compact Power Strip for Work and Travel, 5 ft Detachable Extension Cord with 6 Ports, to give me some additional ports and make my workflow more comfortable as well as everything else or something like it.  So consider that you may need that.  I would say that is my only Con besides Windows 11 ....grrr.  I had been using Win 10 because my old laptop could not be upgraded to Windows 11.  So lots of making it better for me.  THis laptop has Win 11 Pro.I love that it integrates with my phone and tablet with ease,  It is a great laptop.  Lightweight.  Samsung did think this out well.

But you can purchase skins that are pretty and are designed to fit exactly the shape.  Bought one but have not put it on the laptop.As for a noisy fan others talk about, I have not heard the fans kicking in.  It runs not hot but warmer than my HP was.  About the same as My Sony Vaio.  This laptop is a really great investment.By the way, it has a back lit keyboard, no touchscreen (I did not use anyway).  Feels sturdy, I just wish it had more ports and a longer battery life.  Came with 60W charger and cord.  Amoled screen.  Fingerprint scanner on power button which since I am using at home  I bypassed using it.

But I needed a second one with different specs.Pros: the hardware is clean, slim, and beautiful. The laptop is very lightweight and portable. Fingerprint reader was a pleasant surprise. I didn’t see that in product specs when ordering.Cons: Tons of bloatware to remove. And many programs you’ll have to google to see what they do as it’s not obvious by the name. The touchpad is huge and low, so low that my wrist keeps activating the right-click menus or jumping the cursor on screen. I have to use a Bluetooth mouse, which means airplane mode will be a problem. That brings me to next con: only one USB port and only two C ports.

I’ve already replaced it because this little guy, has a bunch of BIG problems, and I cannot recommend this as a budget friendly PC, in fact, I’m not even really sure why HP continues to produce such a device.First things first, the Disk Space, comes in at a messily 32 GB, that is pathetic for a PC by any standards, your phone probably has more storage then that, as soon as you boot up the PC, you’re going to need to do some updates, after that’s all completed, you’ll have roughly about 5-10 GB of free storage. I thought at first an SD card or a external disk drive would help resolve this issue, but the PC is SLOW regardless.When i first bought it, it ran games very smoothly, but now, after updates and all, the PC can’t even handle a simple flash game without lag and stutter, you cannot even watch a YouTube video without it lagging on you, don’t even think about browsing more then 1 web page. This is all at fault of the poor 4 GB of RAM, which for those that don’t know, the more RAM your PC has, the better it will run. I highly recommend you get yourself a budget PC with at least 8GB or RAM on it. I can’t even recommend this PC as a budget friendly PC, it just is not a good choice. For $299 you get 32gb of Disk Space and 4 GB of RAM, I got my Gateway PC at Walmart for the same price but with 512GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Please for the life of you look for something better, this isn’t it, if your looking for a budget PC, spend that extra $100 it’s going to serve you well in the long run, other wise your going to be $500 out of pocket like I am! There isn’t even enough storage space on the PC to do a factory reset! You cannot even reset the PC because the lack of storage.I want set it straight, this is not Amazons fault, this isn’t their product it’s HP, this is not a good PC, not even a good casual one, please skip this one and do yourself a favor and go the extra and throw in that $100 for a good reliable PC, it will be worth it! I don’t wish the troubles and frustration I had with this PC on anyone.",know what your getting into..,2020-05-13,1.0

The mini PC came nicely packaged with foam and a sturdy box so the product arrived undamaged and intact. I tested the video performance of this computer and it's only so-so nothing really to rave about nor complain about. It does have a few interesting options that make it well suited for some applications.The mini PC has a low power Celeron N95 processor, TDP 15W but uses considerably less in most situations. Total power usage of this mini PC just running Windows and a web browser was in total 15 watts as measured by one of the power stations. The computer has three USB ports, three HDMI ports, two NIC interfaces, and one audio port. The supplied AC adapter supplies a maximum of 30 watts and is fairly compact for its wattage.I took a picture of this mini PC compared to the micro form factor I use on my desktop. The mini PC is considerably smaller in foot print, weight, and power usage. I disassembled the mini PC and it uses a 256GB M.2 SATA drive which is considerably slower than an M.2 PCIe interface drive which is fairly common on most computer nowadays. The memory was soldered to the mainboard and is not upgradeable and the SSD which is SATA is upgradeable but there isn't a lot choices out there for M.2 SATA drives as almost all the manufacturers have opted to use the PCIe interfac because the speed is so much faster. The wireless card is an 802.11AC WiFi card or WiFi5 and does not support WiFi6, WiFi6e, or WiFi 7 soon to be released. The wireless card is on an M.2 interface and is interchangeable to a newer WiFi card with higher speeds. The onboard graphics supported my monitors 3440 x 1440 resolution, but abet only 49.9 Hz refresh rate, much slower than what the monitor is capable of which is 100Hz at that resolution.The interesting configuration is the fact they've included two wired ethernet connection input and three HDMI output ports. Having three HDMI ports makes this a good surveillance machine you can connect three smaller monitors to this machine to review or see three different cameras and the dual ethernet ports means you can bridge between your network and the camera or surveillance network device. I disassembled the mini PC and you can see that the memory isn't upgradeable, the SSD and M.2 wireless card can be upgraded but I don't expect many people that buy this mini PC will upgrade the  drive or the wireless card. Overall I think the computer is a compelling purchase if you need multiple monitor displays and/or need a computer that can bridge two separate networks think of security systems and its low power makes it inexpensive to operate good as a frontend to a camera network.",Very compact and low power mini PC useful for some applications,2023-09-26,4.0,R38N3AJ5YQIUU1,Edisme,1.0,"I'll start by saying the aluminum, finish, footpads, etc are all excellent and all look really nice. The glaring issue is in the design and could potentially be a problem for users of this stand.Firstly, the instructions that come with the stand say that using the lowest or second to lowest height setting is not recommended. The 1st setting provides approx 4"" of lift, which for laptop users is probably already too high. For tablet users, this might be fine. It's a shame, because otherwise this is really well made and looks great. If you're looking for a laptop stand to get a small amount of lift to improve airflow, you may want to look elsewhere.",So close to really nice,2023-07-17,2.0

It seems with all the things coming up 32 might be necessary to run all we like to do  Cannot add more Ram, can add/upgrade the hard drive.Very QuietKeys fabulousTouchpad -- large but really nice (and I hate touchpads ... I use my Wacom Graphics Tablet. )Battery respectable; however, it depends on if you use 120 hz or 60 hz, and what all you are doing.  It can last a long time for normal texting and surfing etc., but if working, it goes fairly fast.  You therefore need to keep a charging port open to use to charge.  With no separate battery, it uses the connections leaving you with what is left for your devices  Then you have left a C and a USB 3.2, HDMI.  I don't use HDMI but might for a second display, but with my Wacom needing usb 3.2, my 2 external hard drives also need one 3.2 and one C.  I work on graphics, photos, etc., all day, and need those back ups.  For me it is critical to get the Anker Prime 6-in-1 USB C Charging Station, 140W Compact Power Strip for Work and Travel, 5 ft Detachable Extension Cord with 6 Ports, to give me some additional ports and make my workflow more comfortable as well as everything else or something like it.  So consider that you may need that.  I would say that is my only Con besides Windows 11 ....grrr.  I had been using Win 10 because my old laptop could not be upgraded to Windows 11.  So lots of making it better for me.  THis laptop has Win 11 Pro.I love that it integrates with my phone and tablet with ease,  It is a great laptop.  Lightweight.  Samsung did think this out well.

Bought one but have not put it on the laptop.As for a noisy fan others talk about, I have not heard the fans kicking in.  It runs not hot but warmer than my HP was.  About the same as My Sony Vaio.  This laptop is a really great investment.By the way, it has a back lit keyboard, no touchscreen (I did not use anyway).  Feels sturdy, I just wish it had more ports and a longer battery life.  Came with 60W charger and cord.  Amoled screen.  Fingerprint scanner on power button which since I am using at home  I bypassed using it.

I didn’t see that in product specs when ordering.Cons: Tons of bloatware to remove. And many programs you’ll have to google to see what they do as it’s not obvious by the name. The touchpad is huge and low, so low that my wrist keeps activating the right-click menus or jumping the cursor on screen. I have to use a Bluetooth mouse, which means airplane mode will be a problem. That brings me to next con: only one USB port and only two C ports.

You can throw a lot at it and it won't budge, however, do be mindful that this is still a laptop.  Cooling will be the primary issue as is the case with most other laptops.The good- The version I received came with a 10 core 12th gen i7, a dedicated 4050 GPU with 6GB of VRAM.  This is more than sufficient for my gaming, photoshop, programming, and productions needs.  I debated splurging on a laptop with a larger 17"" screen, for my purposes though 15"" is enough.  The brightness and clarity are great.  144Hz is an excellent feature, but considering the nature of this machine I would prefer 120Hz.  Allow me to clarify, I understand Hz has everything to do with the screen refresh rate.  I also understand most games can be capped around 120FPS, by capping the two it can allow cooling headroom.The mediocre- at $1K is 512GB of SSD space the best you can really do?  I immediately took my machine apart and installed an aftermarket 4TB crucial NVMe and a 4TB Samsung 980 Evo, in addition to replacing the RAM from 16GB to 64GB.  I understand this sounds like overkill, and it is... to an extent.  Beyond gaming I run virtualization software and edit photography shots for my side gig.  Running virtualized labs exhausts a lot of resources, and due to the nature of travel associated with my work, I can't always utilize my desktop.  Audio isn't the greatest on this machine either, the sounds are washed out due to the speakers being place on the bottom.The bad - expandability.  This is 2023, disk space should be expandable by now without voiding the warranty.  I am well aware I can purchase an external drive, but it blows my mind that modern day devices have the ability to be customized - e.g Disk space/RAM, etc, but the warranty must be void in order to do so.  These are relatively low risk modifications.The ugly- cooling, 100%.  MSI BIOS by default runs turbo, add Windows 11 to the mix and you have a deadly concoction on your hands.  This toasty boi almost peaked around 92C.  Yes, modern day equipment can run this hot, will it stand the test of time though?  I am not one to take that risk.  I managed to take 20C off of my average temps, which should hopefully increase the longevity of my laptop.What would my suggestion to the manufacturer be?- First and foremost disable turbo, it's unnecessary.  The laptop is certainly capable of performing under extreme workloads but it's not exactly practical when the temperature is teetering around it's throttle limit.- A thicker base for a more robust heatsink.  I know this is counterintuitive to the specific design of this product since it is supposed to be thing.  This could expand the life of the product though.Suggestions for the consumer- Turn off turbo in BIOS, it requires enabling advanced mode but the rewards are worth it.- Get rid of Windows 11, it's absolute garbage in its current state.  Maybe by the next iteration they will have fixed it.  For now, install Windows 10 via USB or install a user friendly Linux Distro like Mint, Debian, or Ubuntu.- Purchase an aftermarket laptop stand/cooler.  I don't have any particular one to suggest since I'm still in the search for something I think will perform the job correctly.Final thoughtsThis is a solid 7.5/10 laptop.  It's not bleeding edge by today's standards, but it will do more than just get you by especially if you are a student on a budget who enjoys games on the side.  This laptop also serves as a great multipurpose device with a few component modifications.  That all depends on if you are willing to risk voiding the warranty or not.  As an IT professional I suggest not doing so if you are not comfortable with the thought of that.","The good, the bad, and the ugly",2023-06-03,4.0,R2LET4Y973RTQB,Miao,0.0,"I received this 9/11, and start use it on 9/13 after re-installing the Microsoft system. I found the keyboard, screen, electricity and attachments are all nice. This is a relative cheap price according to the set-ups.However, the TouchPad is completely not usable. I opened it 9/12 and found the TouchPad is off, so I tried fn-f3 and re-installing the system. When I start again on 9/13, the TouchPad is still off. I also tried to install msi TouchPad drive and turn off the I2C HID in device management, but nothing changes. I may consider this as a hardware break.I can use my mouse to control the computer, and I have a lot of work to do on it, so there is a large chance that I will not return it or change it (except the seller is kind enough to mail me a new one before I give it back :>). I will use the MSI warranty instead, but it will be several months after that.I typed this rate on 9/14 00:30, after tried several hours trying to repair TouchPad. I will recommend this, since 700-800 dollars is really not expensive under this set of laptop; I also believe that the TouchPad broken on a new laptop is really rare thing. I am sharing my real experience and remain this as an evidence.Thank you for reading! Can anyone provide solution to this problem?","Most are good, TouchPad is down",2023-09-14,3.0

This is my second chromebook and the reason I am leaving the first is that it is still blazing fast, still has superior battery life, but is unsupported by google and receives no updates other than critical security patches. This machine will be supported until 2029 apparently.So here's what I have found. The size is the same as my high end 14"" ThinkPad. Very very convenient size that will fit easily in a small duffel bag or backpack for travel. The keyboard is tight (like a 14"" laptop) but has big easy to use keys and the texture (lol) feels pretty good on the finger tips.  It boots up and closes in seconds, still faster than an IBM Pc. Typical for a chromebook is that there is no delete key so the backspace gets double duty.What I especially like is the USB-C charging from either port and the slot for a memory card. The USB-C will also enable you to charge a phone or other device from the chromebook battery or the charger itself which saves you from having to carry multiple chargers for this machine and your phone. The camera is about average.The downside and what other less than 5 star reviews comment on is the quality of the display. It's not very sharp and the viewing angle can be a little tricky.Overall this is a great value. I will be updating this review (for real) after I have about 6 months of use on it.",Great value (on sale) - Display is the shortcoming,2022-11-22,4.0,R2DVAJI2U2KKNS,David Okwii,9.0,"I own a Galaxy Chromebook Go myself and I have it for one and half years now. Like most reviewers have written, the 1366 x'0 768 resolution display is a let down and the Intel Celeron N4500 1.1Ghz processor won't let you do multitasking and 32GB onboard storage is quite small. But this is pretty much the specs of 99% of Chromebooks in this price range. Actually this laptop gives much more screen real estate, thanks for 14"" screen instead of the much smaller 11"" displays typical of Chromebooks. And with WiFi6 support instead of the usual WiFi 5 typical of Chromebooks, you have to cut it some slack. Also you can't complain that it doesn't have an HDMI port. That's practically every Chromebook which has shifted to USB-C for both display and Charging.Alright, I've personally enjoyed using this Chromebook. For the current price point of $215 on Amazon, I think it's worth the extra screen real estate, faster WiFi, two USB-C ports, a USB-A port, microSD card slot and headphone jack slot. Plus I really like the touchpad and keyboard, it's a lot better than even premium laptops I have used like my Asus Vivobook. The hinge is still solid. The battery is still almost all day.However, I can't say it has aged gracefully because I have a lot of scratches on the plastic back. The down firing speakers included under the base are average, but good for casual Spofify listening. Also I think Samsung should have included at least 64GB just like it's competitor in this price point. And Samsung should have made the screen Full HD 1080 instead of 720 to differentiate itself from its competitors in this price range.In summary, I use this laptop as an in-between my Mac Mini desktop machine which I use for serious video and photo editing and Asus VivoBook dualbooted with both Windows and Linux which I use for website development. I take this Chromebook with me to the cafe or on a Safari or casual browing in the living room. If you don't get this baby, then I recommend a cheaper but smaller screen Lenovo IdeaPad 3 HD 11.6″ Chromebook, ASUS C223 Chromebook or HP 11a Chrombook(11a-na0010nr).","Big on screen and battery, average performance",2023-01-13,3.0

I've had this Ideapad for about a week and I'm still not sure if I'll keep it.1]You need a Microsoft account to set it up. You cannot skip it, you NEED to add an email address at the start. It’s been a while since I’ve set up a laptop, but is this the new standard? Why? It’s one thing to require an account if I were to use OneDrive or Word/Excel, but to just set up a laptop? Seems pushy. Speaking of which…2]The laptop starts in Windows S mode “to protect its users.” And by “protecting its users”, it locks you into the Microsoft ecosystem where you cannot use any apps not Microsoft approved. No Chrome, no Adobe, nothing. Bless your heart, Microsoft, but can I use the laptop I paid for to do whatever I want without you blocking me from the get-go? I’m perfectly fine with S mode as an option, but forcing it on me and requiring me to go through extra steps to get it off is an unnecessary encumbrance. Oh, and you’ll need a Microsoft account to get rid of it (there are tutorials showing how to leave S mode without an account, but they’re temporary).3]The anti glare, ironically, hurts my eyes. No matter what angle I adjust the screen, no matter what light source I use, the whiteness of the screen washes out the text. I need to use accessibility settings to read pages, which I’ve never had to do before. Even so, there are certain pictures, like a light object against a white background, that I just cannot see with this screen. I have to dim it 50%.4]It’s a bit slow. Switching tabs takes a few seconds. Sometimes it lags when I type. Not deal breakers, but considering this is a brand new laptop with nothing installed, it’s a bit concerning.5]When you type, a little “abc” notification pops up. Of all the things, this is the one that irrationally pisses me off. Why is this here? To tell me when I’m on capslock? Don’t you think I’d figure out if I have capslock after, you know, I press the capslock button? I cannot fathom why anyone thought this was a good idea. Yes, I figured out how to disable it, but why was it there in the first place?Anyway, the laptop works for what I want: watching videos, doing light spreadsheet work, and checking emails. I cannot complain about that. But I had to do a lot of fiddling to find settings to make it usable, while previous laptops worked fine right out of the box. I’m still deciding if the pet peeves above are irritating enough for me to return it. But so far, so…ok.Update: I've decided to return it. I couldn't get the screen to work decently; videos and text blended too much into the white background. And it was tabs were too slow to navigate through; it shouldn't be this slow in a brand new computer. i'm sure other people won't mind it too much, but for me, it was a dealbreaker.",Still on the fence,2023-08-07,3.0

Fast forward 3 days later I turned my computer on and it was just at a black screen nothing was happening. Turned it off then back on black screen still present. Called Acer support told them that after the computer tried to up date and next day I turned it on that was present they walked me through so steps to reset the software and 5 minutes later it was running again. To say the least it’s fast it plays Fortnite really well with no issues and few other games I play. The downside to this PC is all the bloatware I tried deleting the bloatware some won’t let me delete and the others I click delete and it freezes up on the task.

The shipping was delayed but nothing too extreme. The first problem I noticed is the Touch Pad. I am unable to use two fingers and scroll up and down on a page. This machine was purchased for my company and we found this issue a major problem in our operations. However, I said ""It's fine, we will work around it and use a mouse"". That went alright for the first 10 minutes until I found that some of the keys aren't functioning the way they should be. This includes the brightness of the screen (bright and dim) seems to refresh and tab through sections vs lowering and raising the brightness. The other function that doesn't work is the volume buttons ( again, up and down ). This became frustrating quite quickly. Again, I said we will work around this issue. The final straw was when we were setting up the laptop. We found that we couldn't install drivers for the touch pad because they are not available. Also, we are not able to use the finger print feature to unlock the computer. Again, we are not able to install drivers because they are not available. At the end of the day, we have decided to move forward with a return and refund.PLEASE BE AWARE******THIS IS NOT A BAD LAPTOP. For the price, this laptop is exceptional. It will get the job done if you plan to use a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse. With the occasional ""laptop"" setting. I am still able to function with added steps but it becomes frustrating as I operate on other laptops that function the way that I want them too. Please do not be afraid to purchase this laptop as renewed because it is exactly that. I am still able to do all the functions of my job as needed but takes different steps. IT WILL GET THE JOB DONE.So please keep that in mind.",PLEASE READ ENTIRE REVIEW. Good laptop,2022-12-05,3.0

It seems with all the things coming up 32 might be necessary to run all we like to do  Cannot add more Ram, can add/upgrade the hard drive.Very QuietKeys fabulousTouchpad -- large but really nice (and I hate touchpads ... I use my Wacom Graphics Tablet. )Battery respectable; however, it depends on if you use 120 hz or 60 hz, and what all you are doing.  It can last a long time for normal texting and surfing etc., but if working, it goes fairly fast.  You therefore need to keep a charging port open to use to charge.  With no separate battery, it uses the connections leaving you with what is left for your devices  Then you have left a C and a USB 3.2, HDMI.  I don't use HDMI but might for a second display, but with my Wacom needing usb 3.2, my 2 external hard drives also need one 3.2 and one C.  I work on graphics, photos, etc., all day, and need those back ups.  For me it is critical to get the Anker Prime 6-in-1 USB C Charging Station, 140W Compact Power Strip for Work and Travel, 5 ft Detachable Extension Cord with 6 Ports, to give me some additional ports and make my workflow more comfortable as well as everything else or something like it.  So consider that you may need that.  I would say that is my only Con besides Windows 11 ....grrr.  I had been using Win 10 because my old laptop could not be upgraded to Windows 11.  So lots of making it better for me.  THis laptop has Win 11 Pro.I love that it integrates with my phone and tablet with ease,  It is a great laptop.  Lightweight.  Samsung did think this out well.  The screen... wow....  it is amazing.  You have to see it to believe it.I could not get the beige one as it was not available at the time of purchase in this build.  But you can purchase skins that are pretty and are designed to fit exactly the shape.  Bought one but have not put it on the laptop.As for a noisy fan others talk about, I have not heard the fans kicking in.  It runs not hot but warmer than my HP was.  About the same as My Sony Vaio.  This laptop is a really great investment.By the way, it has a back lit keyboard, no touchscreen (I did not use anyway).  Feels sturdy, I just wish it had more ports and a longer battery life.  Came with 60W charger and cord.  Amoled screen.  Fingerprint scanner on power button which since I am using at home  I bypassed using it.  Graphite not a bad color, and I do not find it is a fingerprint magnet.  Did I say I love it!  Thank you Amazon and Samsung.",The Best!!!!

But I needed a second one with different specs.Pros: the hardware is clean, slim, and beautiful. The laptop is very lightweight and portable. Fingerprint reader was a pleasant surprise. I didn’t see that in product specs when ordering.Cons: Tons of bloatware to remove. And many programs you’ll have to google to see what they do as it’s not obvious by the name. The touchpad is huge and low, so low that my wrist keeps activating the right-click menus or jumping the cursor on screen. I have to use a Bluetooth mouse, which means airplane mode will be a problem. That brings me to next con: only one USB port and only two C ports.

As for the touch pad, it is bigger than my HP, which causes my hands to touch the pad setting off the settings. It will highlight what I typed and erase it.

Pages are painfully slow to load and I'm sitting right next to the wifi router. Despite being dual-band, I find the laptop cannot detect wifi signals in places my old laptop could. Zoom meetings freeze.The USB ports are incredibly slow to charge even my cellphone. (1-2% per hour).The Adaptor.There is no light to indicate whether the cord is plugged in and/or charging. Often I need to jiggle the cable to ensure it is connected properly until the charging icon appears over the battery icon in the taskbar. However, if you're watching a movie and it disconnects, you'll find your computer is draining without realising it.The adaptor plug is absolutely massive, making it awkward to find somewhere to plug it if you're using adaptors or extension cords (pic attached). The cord itself is only around a metre long.Overall, it's a satisfactory computer for simple needs.

However, I have never really been fully satisfied with a laptop I have owned in my life and there have been quite a few. This laptop is not perfect by any means, but, of all the others I have owned it is by far the best one. Because of that I definitely think 5 stars are justified even though I will list some minor complaints below.Some positive qualities:- Screen quality: The screen is amazing. I'm a big fan of OLEDs but this display is very satisfying for a laptop. The dual mode is very convenient as well - for more demanding games I do find myself switching modes. It is worth the reboot. The 240Hz refresh rate makes me spend a lot of time in the lower resolution mode as well.- Build quality: This laptop feels like one of the most solid Windows laptops I have ever owned. Being aluminum I was picturing a solid old macbook like stiffness, but it definitely isn't that thick which is a bit sad. However, I got over it pretty fast because this thing looks and feels great to handle.- Software: The setup experience was one of the most refreshing of any laptop I have purchased. No bloat. I didn't have to spend a half hour uninstalling crap from the manufacturer. There weren't 10 different applications I needed to use to change settings. I am also able to do things like switch to only using the dedicated GPU and not even using the integrated graphics, an experience I have never had the joy of being given compared to the big manufacturers that lock you out of things like that.- Charger: I am used to having big bulky chargers with all of my powerful laptops, but this charger is definitely the smallest of the bunch. I also really am a fan of the power connector and how solidly it connects to the laptop body.- Looks: I just wanted to put a specific section here to say this laptop finally satisfied my desire for a true dual use laptop - work and play on the road. The laptop does look super professional. No over the top RGB - no crazy gaming graphics. Just one logo and a light up keyboard which can be disabled (but I felt no need to - it isn't over the top in normal usage).- Low power charge support: This laptop handles being charged on lower output USB C chargers like a champ. No other power hungry laptop I have tried lets me plug into a 60W USB C wall charger and actually report some charging capability when demand is low. The system will charge when sleeping or powered off without issue with any charger I've tried it with.Some general thoughts:- Heat management: I've had laptops with louder fans, and I've had laptops that ran cooler, but to me this is a solid performer in terms of heat management. I've never felt the laptop was too hot sitting on my lap. When gaming on a table I also never have felt I was going to burn a hole in the table as with some gaming laptops in my past.- Touchpad: At first, I was extremely annoyed by the touch pad. I was constantly randomly scrolling or selecting or dragging things, sometimes even just by dirt or a piece of hair being on the touchpad. But I turned the sensitivity down in the windows settings menu and this all went away. I also turned off the 3/4 finger gestures since I don't use them - so that may have helped as well. If you really enjoy those this could be an issue. But, overall I am positive on the touchpad. I don't mind the size and enjoy the feel of the clicks and performance of scrolling and tapping.- Performance: For non gaming performance, I have been super impressed. It tears away at any work I throw at it. In terms of gaming performance, it is also pretty good. But I really have only casually gamed on this laptop. In Halo Infinite I get about 150FPS in High graphics modes with the screen not in 4K mode. Plenty to keep me satisfied, but maybe I should have just sprung for the 4080 to bump it up a big more in 4K mode.- Battery life: Battery life is pretty good. Far better than my past gaming laptops. But there is one minor annoyance I have and that is that Windows won't accurately estimate battery life. The battery will be at 80% and Windows will say ""5 minutes remaining"" of battery life. I don't know if that's Microsoft's fault or something with the Razer drives/BIOS, but it is there regardless.- Weight: This is the heaviest laptop I have owned so far. But I don't care - it feels solid in a good way. But I wanted to mention it since that is important to some people.Some negatives:- Screen backlight uniformity: On the bottom of the screen I have three noticeable spots where the backlight is not uniform. But, these are only visible when the screen is completely black. I have never noticed it watching videos or gaming on the display - only when the laptop reboots or is changing power states. It bugs me knowing those spots are there at this price point - but once again they don't affect anything during usage. So annoying but not a huge deal.- Fan placement: If you pick up the laptop in the right place (which I seem to do 70% of the time), you will be grabbing right under the fan grille and actually stop the fan from spinning since the grille flexes inwards. The noise is a bit alarming and I feel it probably isn't great for the fans. Yes, eventually I am sure I will get used to picking it up ""the right way"" but I have never had to worry about this before with a laptop. And somehow I almost always pick it up and do this unless I am specifically thinking ""I must be very careful picking my laptop up off the table""So, overall, I am super happy. This laptop isn't perfect - but I don't think for me a perfect laptop exists. With that being said this is the best laptop I have owned and I will definitely stay in this line of laptops for the future if they still appear to be similar quality when it comes time for an upgrade!",My favorite laptop so far!,2023-05-16,5.0,R1UKB5AWWRQQHK,AH,7.0,"EDIT 7/9/23: I got yet another Blade 16 replacement after I returned the one with a defective GPU.

This replacement unit seems to have a defective GPU! Unstable and games keep crashing. C’mon Razer!This Blade 16 Mercury is my first laptop from Razer. The build quality is amazing, feels like a MacBook, and the specs in this laptop are truly outstanding. Sadly, within about 2 weeks of owning this laptop, the screen has started to show signs of failure, with vertical and horizontal lines appearing on the screen. It's important to note that Razer advertises an ""AUO"" branded miniLED display for their Blade 16s, but my mercury model came with a ""BOE"" miniLED branded one. Will be returning to Amazon as a defective unit, I would really like to buy another to replace it because there are no other laptops in the market that has similar build quality & specs, but it's risky knowing that their products can fail like this at any time.","Mercury model is amazing, but 2 defective units so far!",2023-06-19,3.0

There is a slot on the bottom that can be opened in order to access something under it but  I did not try to open or upgrade the item as the specifications on this were pretty strong on stock alone. That being said you should do your research before purchasing this. Based on the current specification, I am sure you do not need to do any upgrades if you are using it for basic use. This is by no means a gaming laptop and cannot handle games as much. This laptop overall is an average size laptop. It is relatively thin but not surface book thin. The specification are not bad for what you get. This laptop is not too heavy and can fit in most laptop bags. It has a quad core celeron processor which is a very basic. The ram is 12 gb which is well over the standard 8 gb for most other lower end laptops. It will definitely work for most daily usage and a bit of heavy multitasking. That being said, it is okay in terms of battery life. It really only last about four  hours on average at most on a full charge. The cooling system is not too noisy on heavy usage. It is a standard charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future. The power brick is okay but it does take up the good amount of space if you happen to plug into a surge protector. Also it does not get hot during charging but do not leave it under a blanket or anything that can keep heat in. Upon boot up of the laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick with its 512 GB SSD. I am unsure if it is an SSD or M2 drive but it boots up pretty quick. The setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. You just need to make sure you have a microsoft account and such. It does run on windows 11 and I am unsure if you can do any downgrades if you like the other windows. The bloatware is not too terrible but I tend to remove those as much as possible. The laptop also has only a 15.6 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. This is a pretty standard laptop screen size. The screen has an okay brightness but not the best on the market. It still keep the traditional two 3.0 USB port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. The laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. The laptop surface where the wrist rest is where I do not like the material. It looks nice with the dark silver but with long term use it will fade over time. The keys are okay, but not the best. They do feel a bit cheap but they are responsive. It will work for me but I am unsure if the keys will fade over time. The external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so I would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. It is sealed inside a nice bag (not sure if it is antistatic) The trackpad runs pretty well, It is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. It also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. There is a camera that will record at at least 720p. You could put a web cam cover on it but it does have a switch on the side to turn the camera on and off which is interesting and unique to this laptop. The microphone is okay but you can hear a bit of choppiness to voice. It does pick up some surrounding noise. On laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. Depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually make this laptop last longer than 4 hours. Best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what I can tell. It is not too long. It has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but uninstall bloatware or whatever you do not need. The speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. Again this is not a gaming laptop as it does not have a powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer. The processor is a simple celeron laptop which is mostly for your daily use. The processing speed is decent and it works really well for say school work. There is an HDMI port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. I am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. Overall this laptop is a decent for a home use laptop. You get an average size screen but this is not a gaming laptop. It can handle some light games but nothing intense. The laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is okay. The specification is not bad at 12 GB ram and 512 gb SSD drive. The space is decent for what a student may need. It is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work or basic computer with a single monitor connection. You could do more screens if you use type c.","Good for everyday tasks, decent quality laptop for the price",2023-03-07,5.0,R1HVCAAMSXSM21,ethan hinojosa,2.0,This computer is good for the price it’s asking. The mark down is meant to make this look like a steal. After having this laptop of 2 days I already processed the return. It heated up so quickly just running chrome.

It looks like that the laptop wants to connect but it immediately disconnects.4. The embedded  fingerprint reader in the power button is very flaky, it worked the first time, did not survive a reboot. Enrolled two fingers again, worked while ON and again, disappeared after the reboot.5. It does not have Thunderbolt ports, only USB3.x, therefore the backup to either and external USB drive or a NAS, is about 330-350Mb/s as opposed to the same external devices from an LG17 which has the Thunderbolt ports, the backup rate is about 1100Mb/s.6. The Samsung 16 Laptop is about 2X the weight of the slightly larger LG17.7. In all fairness, the $1750 cost of the Samsung Laptop is substantially higher with lower performance than other comparable laptops. The earlier mentioned Samsung phone and tablet perform superbly while having a competitive cost, this laptop has neither. Sorry Samsung, I expect another take on the design of such laptops and hope to see a star performer having a competitive price.","Superb and Excellent Video and Sound, Average rest of the components and Performance.",2023-04-20,3.0

I use my Wacom Graphics Tablet. )Battery respectable; however, it depends on if you use 120 hz or 60 hz, and what all you are doing.  It can last a long time for normal texting and surfing etc., but if working, it goes fairly fast.  You therefore need to keep a charging port open to use to charge.  With no separate battery, it uses the connections leaving you with what is left for your devices  Then you have left a C and a USB 3.2, HDMI.  I don't use HDMI but might for a second display, but with my Wacom needing usb 3.2, my 2 external hard drives also need one 3.2 and one C.

This listing contains many very different HP laptops. I got the model with 8 GB DDR4 RAM and 256 GB storage.)I've had this laptop for about a year now, and there have been no major issues besides ones that come from Windows itself or custom hardware upgrades (I upgraded the RAM and SSD, and had issues properly cloning the drive, but that was ultimately my fault). You're getting the performance of a very nice ~$500 laptop, so make sure you get this while it's on sale (which seems to be most of the time... $450 as of this review, $60 dollars less than I bought it at).For casual use:Great! The IPS screen looks great for videos and movies, and the CPU is more than capable enough to run Office tools and whatever other software you may need. It never really seems sluggish, and the battery has a reasonable amount of juice. The keycaps are a bit jiggly, and there's no backlight for usage in the dark, and the power button is just.... really thin, but it's otherwise fairly comfortable to use. No issues with the touchpad, although I wish they'd bring back separate click buttons... Good amount of ports, too.For gaming:Although I was expecting its performance to fall short, it's honestly better than I expected. Minecraft, Roblox, and other various lightweight games run well. The great IPS screen makes gaming feasible as well. If I ever decide to game while I'm not at my PC, I have options. Don't go expecting to play Fortnite or basically any other resource-intensive game on this, though.Technical stuff:This laptop came with 2 sticks of 4 GB DDR4 3200 MHz RAM, filling both slots available. I'm... really not sure why they did it this way instead of putting 1 stick of 8. That makes upgrading so much easier...It also came with a Kioxia 256 GB TLC (I assume based on their other listings) M.2 SSD with decent read/write speed. To replace those parts, you need to pry the rubber feet off the bottom to expose the screws holding the backplate on... that's really the worst part of the process though.If you're using it casually, you likely won't need to upgrade the RAM or storage, but it's getting cheaper and cheaper to do so by the day. I got a 16 GB RAM replacement (one stick; I put it alongside one of the 4 GB sticks for 20 GB total, I don't care about dual channel) and 2 TB storage replacement for under $100 total.","Could be better for price, but isn't bad.",2023-07-13,4.0,R2F65CT7HEK6FR,Chubb,9.0,"We bought this computer to replace one that was ""irredeemable"". It has an i5 Intel processor which appears to be ten times faster than the i3.  I am not sure why the speed has increased, but we like it a whole lot better.  The only way we could make the old one useable was to leave it on 24 hours a day.  This computer closes down when we shut the lid and starts up when we lift it.  The only reason we bought this computer was to have a computer that is only used for financial matters----we do not search the web or receive e-mails.  The main reason we bought this laptop from Amazon was the 4 year extended warranty, which, I was told, included tech support.  We had a lot of problems with the last laptop, and needed tech support which was only good for one year.  (By the way, it is interesting that we enjoyed the last computer until one day Microsoft ""updated"" my windows 10 and then the computer stopped working.  I contacted Microsoft and told them how the computer worked fine until they ""updated"" my computer, and asked if they would fix it.  They said they would be glad to fix it for a $99 charge.  At that point I was loud and angry.  I explained that I felt that this was ransom ware.  ""You screwed up my computer and for $99 you will fix it"".  I said I would not pay such ransom ware money.  I would throw my computer away first and buy a new one.  I contacted Acer tech support and they said they would fix it for nothing.  They did, and when asked how I could keep this from happening again they said just unclick the ""automatic update button"".  I did just that and for 4 years I loved my computer again.)  An update to my review:  the laptop arrived with a crack on the face just to the left of the top left speaker.  I returned the computer to the supplier and they gave me credit for it minus $77.70 for a restocking charge.  No doubt they are restocking the computer so they can sell it to you and pull the same scam on you.-----------A further update on my refund----------The seller (Tech Deals Store) is refusing to refund all my money since I opened the box and started using it before I discovered the crack.

I was looking for a replacement for a three year old model. A brand new version of what I got retails for around $1100. This refurbished unit was in perfect condition. It was supposed to have a fingerprint reader but I contacted the vendor and discovered that they had been misinformed. They rapidly rectified the issue in days with just a couple emails.The computer itself was clean, the display is delightfully clear and bright. The AMD Ryzen CPU is more than twice as fast as the machine it replaces. It has run everything I need with plenty of headroom (typically running less than 6% CPU. The NvME SSD is blazing fast.) The 16 gigabytes of RAM is provided by two SoDIMM which allows dual-channel, interleaved access making it even a little faster. I've used it on an external monitor and gotten great 4K results at 60 Hertz. This was a great bargain. Plus, the vendor support was excellent.I want to call out the specs on this again. AMD has an excellent line of CPUs and are comparable to Intel's latest generation. The construction of the ProBook follows the same frame design as the EliteBook which is the top of the line business machine, with fewer ports. It would be hard to match this for anywhere near this price. I've used other Amazon refurb products and been pleased at the value.

Do not expect it to run the latest games or any graphically intensive applications.  With that stated, I am utilizing these at a non profit charity that which mostly utilizes cloud based applications.  These computers work very well at this task while providing the future proofing of being Windows 11 compliant.We are replacing ACER Aspire E15 series laptops with this model.  The E15s were mostly generation 7 & 8 I3 and i5 models with SATA III SSDs and 8GB of RAM.  The NVMe drives are much faster than the older SATA III drives.  I miss the extra RAM, but not enough to crack open these cases for upgrades.  My volunteers appreciate the lighter weight and slimmer size.  I don't remember the last time we actually utilized an optical drive or card reader which were lost with the slimmer case.These have smaller batteries than our older models.  That coupled with the CPU and RAM workload increase, means that I anticipate 5 - 6 hours of battery life utilizing basic cloud based applications.  Streaming movies or playing basic games will decrease the life more.  Non CPU intensive desktop productivity software should increase the battery life.  The power port is proprietary so you will need to carry the brick and cords if you need more battery life during your day.  From an IT prospective, this is a blessing due to the number of infected USB C chargers that have begun popping up in public spaces.Most of the volunteers in the organization are older and greatly appreciate the larger display size.  There is no touch display option.  The maximum resolution is 1920x1080, but the overall quality does not keep up with mid level or elite laptops.  The viewing angle is about 120 degrees from the side and less from the top.  Graphics performance is low.  The colors are not as rich and the contrast is not as dynamic as better displays.  This does include HDMI 2.0.  I do not think it could drive a display with higher resolution very well though.  It is fine for plugging presentations in to a projector or large display.  I do not see much improvement on this display vs the 2017 - 2019 ACER E15 series laptops these are replacing.The webcam is basic.  The speakers are small and face down.  There is a single microphone.  If you speak on calls, a headset is a must.  If you listen on calls, this is adequate provided your space is quiet enough for the small speakers.  The overall sound quality is a compromise between value and quality leaning heavily on value.The keyboard is textured.  It is not backlit.  There is not indication that Caps lock or Number Lock are engaged.  So far, I prefer it to the usual flat chiclet keyboards that haunt modern laptops.  The key response is good.  The number pad keys are smaller than the regular keys and some of the buttons are not in standard 10 key locations.  The keyboard also does not use the standard inverted T for the arrow keys.  This is either a learning curve or an annoyance depending on the user.  Time will tell regarding dust and foreign debris issues and how difficult it is to change a key, switch or the entire keyboard.The touchpad is large enough to cover the display area adequately.  It is sensitive enough to cover tap clicking or actual clicking depending on user preference.  I do miss the button that disables the touchpad to eliminate palm pressing, but that disappeared with optical drives on every computer.The ports are great.  This laptop has  2 USB 3.2 and one USB C on the left side, and one USB 2.0 on the right side.  It also has gigabit ethernet and HDMI 2.0 on the left side and a headphone port on the right side.  The SD card reader has disappeared to no big loss.  Many of my volunteers prefer corded mice and happen to be right handed.  A USB port on the right side is really nice.  The power port is proprietary since this is USB C instead of Thunderbolt 3/4.  That is a nice range of current and future connectivity.  The average user will not need to utilize a dock or USB hub with this laptop.The WI-FI supports both 2.4 and 5.0 Ghz protocols.  It maxes out at WI-FI 5 speeds.  The built in ethernet port is gigabit which maxes out at 125mbps.  Both are adequate for streaming, web browsing, email, and basic Internet use.  Most home networks are gigabit so this slots in very well.  I was able to maintain transfers at 2.3GBe with a USB 3.2 to 2.5GBe adapter.  There is no wireless upgrade option.You can access the main board and components with nothing more than a 00 Phillips screwdriver.  There is a single RAM slot and it utilizes NVMe 3.0.  The base model is a little light on both RAM and storage, but for a workstation, it is adequate.  For a more power user, you can upgrade both, which is nice and becoming rare in most laptops.  The NVMe drive is not heat shielded nor is it installed in a place with good airflow.  I would not be surprised to encounter heat throttling during periods of heavy use.  The overall drive life may be compromised as well.  Time will tell.  There are no additional unused SATA, PCI, or NVMe ports for expansion.  You cannot upgrade the CPU and there is no expansion port to add discrete graphics.  No surprise there.I immediately exited Windows S mode during initial setup.  Any program that won't allow a user to even utilize a different browser, isn't right for me.  This may be nice if you are attempting to keep users away from applications and websites of questionable origin but our desktop software will never be listed in the MS store and our cloud based software is not stable in Edge.The bottom line is that this laptop is designed for non power users and companies looking for a laptop that is more powerful and less controlled than the average Chromebook.  If your user experience is surfing the Internet, streaming videos, checking email, and running software that will never be listed in an App Store, this is a great option.  If you want to play games, or edit video or graphics, this is not the right choice for you.  Based on previous ACER experience, we anticipate 5 years of service out of these which is a great return of investment.",Not a powerhouse but acceptable for low end workstation use,2023-04-09,4.0,RFUT0KN6Y246L,P. Wallace,16.0,"I was surprised to discover the battery is embedded, in other words can't be removed.  There is a process to charge the battery fully so it will take a full charge throughout its life.  You have to drain it until it reaches about 18%.  A popup should warn you when you reach this battery level; instead you have to keep checking.  Not used to babysitting this computer, the battery ended discharging completely.  I thought connecting the adapter would get the computer up and running.  Not so.  I placed a call to Amazon tech support and learned about battery reset located on the bottom of the computer, a tiny pin-hole that you press a toothpick into for four seconds to reset the battery.  Then you need to long-press the power button for ten seconds to boot it up.  Today I had about 76% battery power left and closed the lid briefly and it turned off.  It took another battery reset and long-press to get it going again.  Chrome tells me it didn't shut down properly, click to restore tabs.  Something with Alexa too, doesn't quite work properly.  So it was a software glitch that caused the problem.  I don't expect this to be the last time this happens.Otherwise this is a well-running machine, no other problems and I've had it 3 - 4 weeks.  Keyboard works fine; I think the screen display is satisfactory (but then again I'm not a techie).  The cover is made of aluminum material and is very attractive with the raised ACER logo in silver.  I can tell that in time, depending on wear and tear, the logo could fall off;  I don't think it's that securely attached.  I paid just below $250, a brand new computer with Windows 11 S mode, which you can disable.  Back to the battery; it will take over 1,000 + charges if maintained properly; it's all in the user manual that can be downloaded from the ACER website.  That adds up to about three years of usage.  The main thing I don't like is having to babysit the battery; you have to go as far to the extremes of discharge and recharge to get maximum usage of it over its lifetime.  So I kind of feel tethered to this thing.  For the price it can't be beat though for looks and basic functioning and I got it at a steal on cyber Monday.  This is my first off-brand computer, ACER not having the brand recognition of Toshiba, sadly;  they only market to the business sector now, in case you're wondering why you don't see them anymore.",Battery is Embedded,2022-12-30,3.0

Thankfully, some of the more objective reviews made some good points and pointed out certain things about this device that made it appealing to me. That combined with the fact it was on sale when I was considering it sealed the deal for me.Some things about this device to note:- Build: Very good, aluminium base and lid with a high quality plastic deck which has been colour matched very well. I got the red and it does have hues of orange here and there, which I like. No creaking but there's a slight flex when holding it at one corner, but it's barely noticeable.- Keyboard: A bit shallow but the keys are a good size and has a nice typing feel to it. I find it enjoyable to use and I'm fairly accurate with it. It's backlit too, with a nice subtle glow.- Speakers: Not very rich in sound, but the sound is clear and sounds good for a device with this profile. It is down firing though.- Touchpad: a bit small, but definitely useable with a nice click and the surface is smooth since it's glass. So thumbs up there.- Webcam: The webcam is 720 and not very good but will do the job, I guess.- Screen: The screen is very nice, it's plenty sharp in this form factor with good colours and deep blacks with great viewing angles.- Battery: Battery life is good, I think I average around 7 to 8 hours. I could probably get 10 out of it if I manage the screen brightness a bit more.- Peformance: This is a 10th gen i3 with 8gb of RAM and while most would say that it's not as good as the 11th gen, this is still a well performing machine. I run multiple tabs at once and the machine remains nice and snappy while using it so performance is very good. It also runs very quiet, I can barely tell the fan is running at times.-Ports: Port selection isn't great, the device only has the two usb c ports on either side but there is an SD card slot to expand the storage plus a headphone jack, which is nice. I invested in a little USB-C hub to provide USB-A and HDMI ports.I would definitely recommend this device and I would buy it again, especially at the discounted price but even when buying it at the full price, it's still a great machine that many would be happy with I think.(I almost forgot to mention, for anyone wondering, mine didn't ship with the massive black sticker on the left of the trackpad that I saw in some reviews, so seems the retail versions don't have it since it's almost impossible to remove cleanly).",A great Chromebook that's often overlooked.,2022-10-01,4.0,R207K5ZFU8SO2H,JHT,8.0,"The screen is fine, battery life, not very good at all. I did read other reviews mention that problem. Likes to put the letter c in randomly.  If you buy this one make sure you have your old and new google passwords because if it signs out and if you don't have your old password you loose any and all files, pictures etc. Read up on how to save the files to this google chrome correctly or everything is gone. I even had my old password, but it wouldn't accept it. Went on google help and found out this is a major issue and google was no help. It won't even do two step verification when this happens, old password or nothing. Then you have everything coming up to sign into different accounts and setup again. It's happened to me twice now.

This has to be the best ""bang for the buck"" machine that I have ever purchased.  The 10th gen 1035G1 i5 is obscenely fast when mixed with the 16gb ddr4 and the 1/2 TB NVMe sdd.  This is elegant as anything as well.  A beautiful chassis.  I was surprised by how light it is.  I guess that is to be expected since I think everything except for the cpu fan is solid state.  The onboard camera is very clear and a driver license text is legible for secure websites.  The CPU includes neural net instructions from the Xeon line for the first time for consumer in the 10th gen chips.  If you are doing data science with development suites like Anaconda using Jupyter notebooks or working with Netbeans or using a MySQL instance for learning this is blazing fast for a great price.In a nutshell, this offers Windows workstation performance with Chromebook simplicity/pricing.*update* (2/2/21)Well I bought this on Dec 16th 19', so I figured an update was in order.  Power on hours read as 2970 according to HWinfo64 and it is still running strong and I have certainly  put it through its paces  Some might say that the UHD G1 graphics are a bit anemic but I think that it's fine for the 1366x768p screen.  Triple A games most likely will be very slow but classic titles like Portal 2 can be played ""maxed out""The Intel 660p QLC drive is also really good i think for the price. Through installing and deleting I have about 13TB worth of mileage on the drive, still very fast, device health of 98% S.M.A.R.T.I have not had any issues with the wi-fi on my unit.  I know it is not the fastest solution out there but on my Asus AC1300 router I get 325mbps from a different floor of the house the hypotenuse length being about 20-25 through a floor and a wall.  I can game on Google Stadia and download a series of torrents and keep my Comcast 100mbps service relatively transmitting a lot of data for hours with no drop-offs on the Wi-Fi.  Now granted I am stationary, I'm not jumping from tabletop to tabletop confusing the beam-forming of the router.So, it a solid performer that can handle some pretty heavy stuff thrown at it.*end of update*",Nice,2019-12-20,5.0,R3BFI75YON5EE9,Amazon Customer,20.0,"Like another reviewer (Alicia) mentioned, I began having full-on problems with my computer a year and a half into buying it. I bought it for around $700 in 2021 for school, and I'm beginning to feel like it's going to die on me any day now.A year into having the computer, I started having weird, minor screen-mouse issues. My screen would glitch out so my mouse would be colored outside of the lines, blurry, pixelated. It'd become bothersome with navigating the rest of my applications-- every time I moved my mouse it would get worse,  maybe glitch another part of my screen-- so I'd have to reboot my computer to get it back to normal. I didn't know what caused it, but it was rare enough and I had pressing deadlines so I didn't think much of it. Probably chalked it up to a software glitch because I ran intensive ones.Months later, now, it's escalated. One day I opened it and it kept flickering black on-and-off with no end in sight. Moving the mouse made navigating hell-- it seemed to make things even *worse*-- I didn't understand how that was possible??? Every time I boot up this laptop-- opening it hours after sleep mode, turning it on after it's been off-- it goes crazy! Only a fresh restart fixes it, sometimes two-- and then it waits for the next time!!Not only that, but my touch screen + its driver is mysteriously missing. There's no way to replace it since it's not on HP's support website and I have no idea if this is at all related to the issue.  I'd suggest maybe Win11 isn't compatible with this laptop if it got purged in an update, but I see reviews mentioning it fine, so no - the computer is just waiting to die.Highly recommend avoiding this laptop and dropping your $$$ elsewhere. Get something that lasts longer because god I wish mine did",Screen / Hardware Issues in 1 1/2 Yrs,2022-11-25,3.0

You can't download anything from other sources. Not even Chrome, for example, which the computer insists you don't need, with a pop-up admonishment. ""For your own good,"" as your mom might say. To get out of this took research. You can't even use REGEDIT in Admin mode (which it considers not to be a Microsoft program!). For someone not very techie or computer literate, S mode is probably very useful, but for me it was quite a hindrance.When I found the steps, the mouse would not click the button to get out of S mode. After two days of madness, I was ready to return the laptop, but then tried plugging in an external mouse. With the external mouse, I finally turned this S mode off. This is a permanent change, no going back.Now it's nkta bad machine. But when I tried pair it wirelessly with my new Fire TV, it could not complete the pairing, though the TV recognized the device. After 20 plus attempts, I've given up for now and bought a long HDMI cable.  Possibly there is some setting I can change to make that work, but it's quite disappointing. I use my TV as a large external monitor when home.Battery life is fair. The plug is huge, and won't fit in some strips. I don't even see where the battery might be. I hope it's not the kind that requires a tech to replace.Though it's large (which I like for the screen size), it's fairly light. It fits into my large backpack, which has a padded computer compartment.  It's light enough to carry around, if unwieldy.Because it's solid state, it usually is ready for me pretty quickly, but longer if it was fully powered off.

As I was changing firms anyway, I figured it was time to get my own backup laptop for doing personal things so that my new work laptop would be solely work. For that reason, I purchased entirely based on all the most recent reviews, and on price.  I dont need an expensive laptop for my own stuff which is mostly email, chat and netflix dramas!  Reviews were great and I figured I can always send it back if it doesn't live up on speed or quality.  Well, the great news is, it lives up on everything.  Even my work laptop was a pile of junk (cheap company with crap investment in people or tech). This is faster, better quality, smoother, lighter, brighter and so simple and easy to use.  It has superb screen quality, particularly watching movies but even for gaming.  The keyboard is bigger than the one on my old laptop but within a few days I had my hands in the right places and didnt need to even look at the keyboard.  The number board is to the right and very smooth to use.  I've used this for important professional meetings with Zoom, Skype and Teams and it worked smoothly and to high standard.  No drop offs or poor quality.  Similarly for using with 365 which is on the laptop on receipt, all programs are working without issues.  I've downloaded lots of usual apps (e.g. WhatsApp) and it works better than my old work laptop.  Speed is perfect, no drag or delay and I'm using it entirely on home wifi.  Price was outstanding for this quality piece of equipment.  If you have a kid in need of a laptop for school study, research and fun, this is it.  If you dont want to spend a fortune on a big brand item for your needs, this is it.  I paid for this myself and am totally pleased wit it to date.  I've got two addtional screens working off of it for spreadsheets, TV and work emails, etc and they smoothly synced in without any issues.  I am totally in love with the bigger, cleaner, bright screen and the quality of sound and visuals, whether work or casual.  I see absolutely no reason to pay more for laptops for home use.  I'm using it for online shopping, emails, video, tv, you tube, social media and chat and its working smoothly for everything.What a great buy!!  Can't find any reason not to recommend this to everyone - for the price point, this is a super sweet deal!  Again, visuals are awesome, bright, colorful and its smooth to work on!  Go for it.",A Super Smooth Piece of Tech!,2023-06-22,5.0,RUBY3LJO0BW1Q,Bekind,16.0,"I'm a little surprised, given the specs, that this laptop isn't faster than it is. It can take a bit of time to load web pages that my desktop puts together lightning fast. Sometimes there's even a minor delay with keying in letters and their appearance on the screen. Not a terribly long one but it's been noticeable.Speaking of typing, wow the smaller size of the righthand shift bar is annoying. I hit the ""up"" arrow next to it all the time. Also, the trackpad is so large that I found myself accidentally hitting it so much that I switched to a mouse and disabled the pad. But this is a pretty common complaint I think with laptops these days.Video can sometimes be a bit jittery. Not smooth. But also, sometimes it's fine. I don't know what issues affect this. Also, if I didn't have a little Bose bluetooth speaker to hook up to this thing I'd be bummed. I use text to speech frequently and the speaker on the laptop is audio misery. Tinny and terrible. Plus, for some reason, with text to speech the speaker dips out at the start of every sentence, cutting the initial word, or part of it, out.When I use the Bose speaker, this doesn't happen. I have no clue why this would be. But I always have that speaker so for me it's not a big deal.Mostly what I use this laptop for is writing and at this task it does fine, slightly regrettable key arrangement notwithstanding. And for the low price I paid, to consider it a glorified typewriter is kind of okay with me.",It does the job but isn't great,2023-07-01,3.0

Sometime when rotating the screen, the display would go crazy flashing and multiplying the images on the screen.  This also happened sometimes when playing videos, but it was intermittent and I couldn't isolate the cause (e.g. browser or video settings).  Finally, today, about 10 months after receipt, the screen went dark when I unplugged it after charging to 100%.  The keys still light up, so it's alive, but it's useless.In addition to the display problem, the touchpad was inconsistent and difficult to operate.  I tried several settings, but even on high sensitivity it often failed to detect a touch and move the cursor in text, for example.I realized I wasn't buying a top of the line product, but I expected basic operational reliability.  The open question is: am I an anecdote, or a trend?------ 3/1/23 update ---------After about 6 months, the unit lost touchpad sensitivity and the screen flickered wildly during videos. When returned to me those problems were fixed but the wireless did not work.  When returned AGAIN, the laptop recognized the local networks and took passwords but would not connect. Eventually I was given a replacement unit.  I lost about 6 months of use of the device and dozens of hours in running through all the phone calls, diagnostic steps, and travel and shipping time.  Now I'm left with 1 month of a warranty on a heavy gamer unit with questionable mouse click keys.  Your support staff was generally helpful, with a couple of exceptions of people who: a) mistyped the serial number, which caused delays, b) filed an RMA number that resulted in no shipping label and required another call to get another RMA number with a label, c) misrepresented my warranty date (I had Amazon order confirmation to prove purchase date), and d) didn't speak English well and/or had poor phone reception.  Bottom line: enough people were helpful enough times that I now have a working laptop, and you have honored your warranty.  Clearly the repair staff didn't run a basic connectivity test before returning the device twice, so I put a note inside the laptop asking for a successful Google search - maybe that's why they first reported ""no problem"" on the 3rd return but eventually did replace the laptop.  I can't speak to the underlying component / supply chain issues following a Pandemic, but I suspect that's a contributing factor.  ASUS has a good price/performance reputation, but next time I'm going to buy something with the highest reliability and warranty.  This circus cost me a lot of time, if not cash.",Screen fails in under 1 year - unit replaced,2022-11-28,2.0

During the initial setup, and for the first 2 days, it was moving a little sluggish, but the Task Manager showed that it was Windows processes that was using most of the CPU and RAM at the time (happens to all computers from time to time). Outside of that, the performance is flawless. I have used it to play Halo: Master Chief Collection, and it runs like a beauty!Wi-Fi speeds are immaculate! The Wi-Fi chip performs flawlessly! Not to mention that it is also equipped with an ethernet port as well. No complaints here.Screen:Upon first bootup of the desktop (after the setup screen), I IMMEDIATELY saw the quality of the screen. Viewing angles are just about perfect as well! This is my first foray into 144Hz territory, and I love it! Transitions are smooth, and I often move the mouse pointer from one corner to another just to enjoy the frame rate. The screen gets plenty bright for indoor use, and suitable for outdoor use as well. Direct sunlight, however, is a bit of a letdown. At the same time, I don't like or suggest using PCs in direct sunlight if possible, as the heat is not good for the device.The color accuracy leaves a little to be desired, as it does not provide 100% of the sRGB color gamut (around 46-55%, I think), so be careful with photo processing. The screen has a matte surface, so there are NO reflections to speak of.Hardware:That being said, this device is great with high/low temps as well! It doesn't slow down with the cold, and it doesn't throttle when hot. The fans do a great job keeping the laptop cool and preventing throttling, even while gaming. Maybe I should try gaming outside in the sunlight....? Perhaps a future edit is in order.Back on track, the fans are audible while performing CPU-heavy tasks (gaming and video processing), but completely quiet while using simple processes, like web browsing and document editing. In fact, I thought the fans turned off, but I can feel a very slight breeze from the back of the device at all times. For simple tasks, this is actually just fine to use in your lap. The rear vents prevent overheating when used on your lap as well. I do not suggest using it in your lap while gaming.The hinge for the screen is sturdy, and the laptop material feels durable and looks good. The keyboard and wrist-rests get smudges, though. Not too fond with that. It is easy to clean with a microfiber cloth, though, so all is not lost.Now, the not so good (don't worry, the list is short):Battery:The battery is easily the greatest letdown for this computer. For everyday tasks, you can get 3-5hrs of battery life, depending on different factors (fan speed, screen brightness, backlit keyboard settings, speaker volume, etc.). However, when gaming, the battery life TANKS! You might get 1:30hrs if you are lucky. For older titles, these metrics change by a lot. But for Halo, for example, I was at 50% in about 40mins. I imagine that video processing would deliver slightly better results, but not aby too much. Keep your plug handy.Speakers:The speakers are decent. Bass is non-existent, but I did not expect that. The vocals, however, are rather clear. The speakers do provide a stereo experience, with the left and right channels working as intended (great for shooting games to know the origin of bullets and footsteps). I typically use Bluetooth or external speakers, so I don't have too many complaints about this.Conclusion:This laptop is a very solid performer for whatever tasks that you want to do, but be mindful of the battery limitations. Keeping this in mind, you won't regret this purchase!",Very fast computer  with mediocre battery life,2023-06-19,5.0,RJPS27EA0F9I9,jesus soto,4.0,"After using the computer for 1 month and a half, it began to show failures. on the screen. and I call for the guarantee and they answer me that I have no way to change it.

In some cases, shipping dead devices. I had previously purchased a refurbished Surface 3, and had good lock with that. So, I would have bought from that company, but they didn't have any more of those, so I had to do a lot more seller review checks on Amazon before I pulled the trigger on this purchase. So it bought this one from some company named ""DealFisher"" selling through Amazon as their warehouse / shipper.I wanted just another Surface 3 (Atom based) as a Windows based beside tablet. My wife wanted one, so I gave her my current one, figuring I didn't really need it and would go back to using my old iPad. That is when I got hit with exactly why I went away from the dam* iPad: Websites that crash the browser. Everyone is using things the poor browser in iOS can't cope with and it crashes them. So they have to reload the page over and over. And it is happening more and more frequently. This does not happen in Windows - thus back to a Surface 3.So the price on this was even cheaper than on a Surface 3. At $300, it was a steal. I didn't even know they made a Core i3 version of the 3 Pro. This is it. The 4 gigs of memory you should really have, but only 64 gigs of storage space. For bedside browsing, this is more than enough.When I unboxed it, the battery was totally dead. I had to charge it for 15 minutes before it would start. But, start it did. And it immediately went into the 'welcome/configuration' screens of a fresh OS install. So it had been wiped and an OS reinstalled. But.. I think it was Windows 8. However I wasn't given much time to figure that out, because once I stepped through the install screens, it immediately pulled down updates, decided it was ready to upgrade to Windows 10 and did so. I didn't mind that because Win 10 is actually an okay tablet OS if you can live with the privacy invasion. (Hint, never use your real name or information if you have concerns. Or if you own an official license, then install Windows 8.1 ) **note: I did revert an older Surface Pro down to Windows 8.1 because it also works an a tablet OS and I feel a little more in control of it when I am going to put important things in there like my company work files and such.Thus began the 24 hours of updates. There were so many updates this thing had to apply. Very often when you finish installing updates, you should make it check again to see if there are updates to the updates. Yes, this really happens. In my case there were many updates. Quite a few required you to reboot so they could finish installing. Then you start again doing the next set of updates. That is life of a fresh install.But, that has nothing to do with the item in question. This Surface 3 Pro is a bit slower than the Core i5 version. If you can afford it, get one of those. If you want a simple adjunct / side computer to whatever you already own, then this works fine. Add on a Micro SD card like a 128 gig card, then you have enough secondary space to store things rather than the tight 64 gig drive. (The card slot for the Micro SD card, is behind the kickstand(llap on the back), out of the way and not along the edge.)This refurbished unit has a great screen with no scratches of chips. The magnesium body doesn't show any scratches or scaring either. I guess I got lucky with this one.Everything on this seems to work, from USB port to charging port, touch screen to speakers. The screen is bright and shows no signs of 'spots' or discoloration. I really think that for every other hangup I have a about Microsoft software, their hardware offerings are always pretty high quality compared to their direct competitors. So I expected and found this to be of the quality I have seen on other new and used Surface devices.The interesting thing with this purchase; It came with a charger to recharge it, as you would expect. However, you would expect a used charger nicely cleaned, twist tied, and tossed in the box. What I actually received was a brand new Microsoft charger for the Surface 3 Pro. I know it is new because (besides the spotless look and the plastic baggy it is in) it came with the cables carefully wound in that pristine way they do at the factory, then each one wrapped with that single band of polyester tape that a knock-off factory would likely not expend the money on. So I felt good about that part of this.The only thing I could ding on this experience was the packaging. It wasn't horrible, and no damage resulted from it, so it is a very minor touch point. The Surface was placed in a padded envelope of the kind they make from bubble wrap. It wasn't sealed, but was just tight enough that the device didn't slide out. That and the charger where then placed in a generic white box, much like a cut-to-fit pizza box of some sort. Good enough to stack on Amazon shelves. Amazon shipped it out in their typical 'way too big' box with just the very minimum of padding. In the end it survived.Why four stars? The device works. It shipped without damage. It had no signs of internal issues so far. It even appears to have shipped with a new power supply / charger. So far so good. I think the only thing I could complain about was packaging. It did't impress me. I don't know who does it. There was a included sticker / slip in the box detailing how vendors had to meet a certain level of quality to sell through Amazon. So maybe the vendor put that in the box, or maybe Amazon just packages the bits into a box. No idea. But it didn't really make me feel like: 'Wow, look at this packaging'. My last Surface 3 was also a refurbished unit.  It came in a very nice box. Clearly branded as a Surface 3 and refurbished. And this wasn't a sticker, but a full on printed-on-shiny cardboard paint job. Some good money spent on that experience. I am pretty sure it was identical to the  original shipping box, as it have the tray it floated in, and a separate box for the power supply. It could easily be that Microsoft had someone doing the official refurb and boxing, and then having someone handle the sales. However, this one was not presented in any such nice fashion.Sometimes you get lucky buying used, and I can't say I did not. It works just fine and I am using it right now to type this up right now, on battery power (which has lasted an expectedly nice amount of time, which on a device that you can not replace the battery in, is a significant issue).",Four out of Five stars - got lucky again buying used.,2017-03-27,4.0,R3K3L9D06SIAZX,Steve W.,31.0,"Update: My 5Ghz band died on the wireless adapter for my Surface.

We can refund you for the device and you may feel free to re-purchase from another seller on our website.Me : Ok.

Otherwise, to put bluntly, these devices are just used, not refurbished.Me : Essentially that's misrepresentation of the product stating it's ""like new"" with a battery that has over 150 cyclesMe : I think Amazon needs to clarify what tests and standards go in the refurb process. I would like an exchange only if I feel confident in the device I will receive. Otherwise, This one still functions for the time beingMonique: The refurbishment process includes a full diagnostics test, replacement of any defective parts, a thorough cleaning and inspection process, and repackaging by the seller or vendor.Me : I understand diagnostics, but what % of a battery is deemed to be bad?Monique: It varies upon usage and we do not have access to the diagnostic specifications of the refurbish process.PROS: 256GB 8GB Ram Surface Pro 3 for $430!

Very dirty and gross, 93%-98% battery capacity w/ 150+ cycles, minor physical wear scratches, nothing major, Outdated Win10 image installed. Questionable ""refurbishment process""I'm disappointed by the ""refurbished- like new"" quality of the description listed for this device. From my experiences with ""refurbished"" items from Apple, Dell, and directly from other manufactures, they literally replace and refurb any wear part on the item making it function and look like new. Batteries are replaced, chassis are cleaned and if damaged, replaced with new parts. In the past, the three generations of Macbook laptops I've bought brand new had hardware issues; versus the discounted factory-refurb 2011 one that's still kicking with absolutely no issues for years on end.That said, this Surface is not ""refurbished"", it's used. The amount of work put into refurbishing it is minimal. The screen was cleaned and the OS was reset so you can complete the reinstall of Windows 10 Pro. Note, the Anniversary update was not applied, after reinstall so an older image was used. As for the back, I can tell you the prior owner was pretty gross. The silver magnesium finish was covered with yellow smudges from the smoker's hands, and on the kick-stand between back of the device along the machined crease was a nasty yellow piece of what looked like ear wax! Gross!At that point I was debating on just shipping it back to Amazon for another replacement or just a return. Since it was already on my desk, and I had latex gloves, isopropyl alcohol and a beer nearby, I've mustered up the willpower to clean this mess. Fortunately, the paper towels used removed nearly all of the nasty mess, with q-tips I was able to remove the rest of the gnarly biological mater from the kickstand. To finish off, I went ahead and used a blower to attempt to blow out any dust accumulated from the heatsink area of the device.All said and done, the device actually looks pretty good. Even though my device's original owner was a nasty slob, at least he didn't drop it or scratched it up too badly. There's a few minor wear marks on the back, but nothing too concerning.I've proceeded to use my most current Windows 10 USB boot disk to perform a clean factory format and reinstall. Everything is good. Updated the firmware, drivers, and checked the battery.You can check the battery by going to command prompt in windows, type: ""powercfg /batteryreport""Overall, the battery usage shows 150 charge/discharge cycles, between 93-98% design capacity after the week of use. I'm not sure if I want to keep this device or just reformat it and send it back.","Update: ""AMAZON REFURBISHED"" is a misrepresentation, really it's just a used device.",2017-03-17,1.0

After setting the system up and using it for three days, the excitement and patience has worn thin, now to off. I have three things installed on the system, and all have become unusable due to the wait for the apps to load or to load content. Those three things are Mircosoft Edge/Firefox (I put them down as one, as I only use one or the other), Adobe Acrobat, and Microsoft Office. Moving from page to page in Edge/Firefox can take 5-20 seconds. Acrobat is unusable. 90% of my productivity comes from Word, Excel and Outlook or Mail. This morning when I picked up the laptop a slight sense of dread sat in, this from knowing I was going to return to 1995 and slow internet efficiencies. When I launched my Office to get to Word it took 11 second for Word to load, it took another 22 seconds for my entire doc to launch. This really breaks my heart because the machine is thin, fast to start up, quiet (no fan) and generally very cool to operate. Since I am being hindered and not enhanced by the machine, it has to go back, and if I am charged a restocking fee at this point I will gladly pay it.I'm going to list off first impressions from opening the shipping box, to start up.1. Opened the Amazon box to find a very basic Chuwi plain box.2. You can only open the Chuwi box from one end, where the power cord and charging brick are in another box, protecting the laptop with another flap.3. Pull out the laptop and you will be surprised as to how thin and light it is. (covered in a simple plastic sleeve with a keyboard/screen protector)4. The charging brick is CHEAP. I don't expect it to last, which is really bad and I'll explain later.5. Plug it in, turn it on, and the standard Windows configuration awaits.6. IT DOES NOT ASK FOR A NETWORK DURING THE SETUP. You can do this easy after the configuration, but for someone new, it will add some difficulty after its all done.7. You set it up with a username and password.8. After you're all done, then you type Update in the dialogue box and start the 10 updates, largely because this ships with a pretty aged build of Windows 10.9. When that's all done run Update again to pick up the three that won't install until the basic upgrades are complete (select Restart).10. Then run Update again to get the most recent security update.11. If you're an Office user you'll also have to run the Mail and Calendar update (in my case it took three tries, but it finally downloaded).12. After all is said and done, you'll download the basics (Adobe Reader, your favorite Office Suite, your favorite VPN and browser, GIMP/Photo Scape - photo editor,  unzipper, an anti-virus software, etc). I also suggest something like Revo Uninstaller. I do not have any affiliation to them, but the standard uninstall built into Windows never completely removes a program, which is nice if you ever decide to reinstall an uninstalled program, but if you want it gone they leave breadcrumbs all throughout the Registry.I suspect all of the Windows updates is because Chuwi purchased an older OEM license for Windows to keep the costs down. For me that's OK, because I customize the configuration and fiddle enough that it gives me the option to opt out of more items than if it was a current default Windows build.Now to the experience. I'm going to say it once for effect, anytime I state a negative remember, this laptop is $350 has a 90% display that is pretty darn good, 8 Gb of RAM and a 256Gb SSD. The RAM and SSD are slow, but it's $350.Opening the laptop - It is magnetic and cannot be opened with one hand. It takes a few tries to find out how to easily open it with two hands.The screen - Aside from a very small light leak in the bottom left corner that is noticeable during the CHUWI splash screen, it is pretty amazing. The bezels are about a 1/4"" around the sides and top. The color accuracy is very good, but the refresh rate is slow. Slow refresh rates are a pain, but not at this price point. IT DOES NOT HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN - Nor does it advertise a touch screen.The Keyboard - It has a very positive response and nice travel. After only a day I have not noticed any reporting errors in dialogue boxes. The backlighting is a joke, largely because the cutouts for the keys are not uniform, and thick as the backlight does not really show through well. The keys themselves are very pronounced with the light exploding around them. This one item brings down my overall review, because the backlighted keyboard was a major selling point.Boot up - It is =/- 15 seconds to the date and time Windows log in screen.Programs - All except the Edge browser and Office apps seem to launch pretty quick. Once inside the app everything works pretty timely. But (remember my disclaimer), apps are not as quick as they are on a desktop, or a $700 plus laptop with faster RAM and SSD. The CPU is not fast, but faster RAM and SSD would help a lot. While RAM is soldered to the motherboard, the Gen 3 m.3 PCIE storage upgrade is easy with a port door on the bottom. I'm not going to upgrade the unit, and can't speak to the speed improvements in doing so.Browser experience with Edge - Slow between sites. Youtube runs fine once you're on the site, but going from video to video there is a delay. There are other browsers out there that might be faster, although I think the limitations are within the laptop, not external to the web, router speeds, or how much pipe you have to the word (the speed at which you connect - although going over phone lines will not help with speed issues).This laptop is a generic stop gap media consumption device for me while I wait for the Apple Silicone Macbook Pro's to come out. Nope, I'm not an Apple fanboy, but attempting to unify around my last year's iPhone 11 purchase has me focused on platform unification. I did the same thing when I had a Windows phone.A p.s. to the Chuwi laptop review. It is fully Linux compatible, and will dual boot.My recommendations and caveats - This is a very nice inexpensive laptop, best suited for lower demand Office apps, media consumption, and lower demand apps. Photo editing is about the highest reasonable use you'll get from it. If you want a gaming system you'll need a drastically different video solution, faster (by a lot) RAM, and SSD. If you're wanting to produce videos, this system will be the bane of your existence. If you're looking for a school system, a small office stop gap laptop for administration (call center, excel sheets, adobe docs) this will be a great solution.Right now Chromebooks are like Unicorns, Leprechauns, and the Boogieman (impossible to find). If you do find one, you won't find one with 8Gb of RAM, 256GB of SSD, or this screen resolution for under $500.I said I'd address the charging block and forgot. I've tried a couple other USB-C chargers and the only one that works (so far) is the one provided with the laptop.In short, this laptop is a fantastic buy.","Honestly, not bad.

The price was great at the time less than $200 ...the specs also weren't too shabby.  Thing is, if you type really fast like I do after a few mins of use it lags.  I type over 100 wpm and everytime I type a sentence I have to pause and wait for it to catch up before I can see what I typed onscreen.  The left side of the laptop gets REALLY HOT after being on for less than 10 mins.  I have yet to locate any vents.  The touch pad even with adjusted sensitivity is TERRIBLE, selecting items, clicking etc takes way too much energy.  Not great for someone like me who works from home on their laptop.

Thus, if your laptop experiences any problems after 30 days, there is no recourse for your problems without absorbing exorbitant costs relative to the laptop's price. The seller is aware of these issues but intentionally does not advertise the voided warranty or the cheap hard drive replacements to customers.Español: Actualizaciones baratas incluídas en la computadora anulan la garantía del fabricante automaticamente. De este modo, si la computadora tuivera problemas despues de 30 dias, no habría más remedio que absorber el costo del reemplazo de la laptop. El vendedor es consciente de estos detalles, pero intencionalmente no les anucia a los clientes la garantía anulada ni el reemplazo con un disco duro barato.I hope some future buyers will find this review useful as an alert to the misleading, shady, and uncooperative business practices of this seller. I bought this Victus Gaming Laptop from this seller sometime around November/December 2022. I enjoyed the laptop for about a month before the hard drive failed. In January 2023, the laptop would no longer start-up, and I was met with a ""3F0"" error. I called HP—the manufacturer of the laptop that the seller says is responsible for the warranty—assuming that the laptop was still under warranty given that it was within one year of purchase. It took a few weeks to work with them over the phone to run tests remotely to assess the problem, during which I couldn't use the laptop for gaming. Ultimately, they determined the problem was due to the SSD hard drive failure. This didn't make sense at the time since I had only used the laptop for light gaming, never having even moved it from my desk. HP requested that I mail in the laptop for repairs. I later received a message from the HP repair team notifying me that it was a hard drive failure due to a ""cheap hard drive replacement"" from a 3rd party. They also informed me that any 3rd party modifications automatically void the warranty, so HP would NOT repair the laptop for free under warranty and instead requested ~$450 to repair it. When I told HP that the laptop arrived to me with these modifications, they responded that they receive many laptops for repairs with these cheap hard drive replacements after purchasing the laptop on Amazon. They acknowledged that this was not my fault but that the warranty was still voided. They suggested I contact the seller instead.I contacted the seller and described the problem. I reasonably requested a refund or other reasonable solution. They responded unapologetically that they ""are not responsible for the warranty which is all up to the manufacture"" and that they only provide the ""standard 30 days return period"". First off, their unapologetic tone and inflexibility in trying to find a reasonable solution are insulting to the customer. Secondly, the upgrades are listed on the page; however, they do not advertise that there is no warranty or recourse if the laptop breaks down. They knowingly say that the ""warranty is up to the manufacturer"" but know that these upgrades will void the warranty. They do not alert their customers to this. It's suspicious that my laptop should break down after 1 month / 30 days, which is right outside their return window. Not notifying the customer that the laptop will not come with a warranty while also replacing the hard drive with a cheap replacement is clearly misleading and disrespectful to customers. I will file a complaint with Amazon and work as many avenues as possible to ensure that other customers do not fall victim to this unfair policy and misleading business practices.","Be wary that warranty is void on purchase, seller is unapologetic and misleading",2023-03-30,1.0

Whatever is playing will just be at a normal consistent volume and then seemingly randomly and unpredictably it'll cut to a lower volume and then stay there. And then if the audio playing gets really quiet and then loud again, it'll be at its original volume for like a millisecond before going back to the lower volume. This happens exclusively with the speaker, as in the headphones work just fine. I've turned off enhancements, changed every setting in the control panel sound settings, options sound settings, uninstalled and reinstalled drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled B&O. Nothing fixes the issue, and it's very noticeable. I sometimes forget the problem exists until I play any audio through the speakers (the volume fluctuating is that noticeable).~~... Okay, so I figured that out. I needed to go to ""device manager"" and instead of trying to update the audio driver by searching automatically for one, I had to instead search for one that came already downloaded on the computer. In this case, what fixed my problem, was setting the audio driver to the HD one, and then going back to the control panel speaker settings, and going to the enhancements tab (that wasn't present before to turn off all enhancements. This 100% fixed the stupid auto volume adjusting crap. (The default audio driver just sucks, not having much needed options.)- - Unlit keyboard with dark colored lettering so it's hard to see regardless, with heavy resistance - -Now I wouldn't mind a single one of these issues if that was the only one existing. But in this case, the keyboard does not have lit keys, has a letter coloring that blends in with the surrounding colors of the keys so even in a well lit room it's hard to make out what they keys are, and the keys themselves take quite some effort to press. Think of like a membrane keyboard, but just a little more resistant than that. Very clicky/noisy too. It doesn't feel great, but I could probably get used to it all.- - 6-bit color bit depth? - -I do notice that the colors on here look a bit off compared to any other display I use (phone and computer monitor). Then when I found that the display was set as a 6-bit color bit depth, I realized that this might be the reason why. After searching all around online to see if this was changeable, I've concluded that this is just part of the limitations of the monitor itself. Not the best, and definitely misleading with how this product is marketed.And then here are some non-issues that I've faced (as in things I've been frustrated with, but it's not that big of a deal).- It comes preloaded with Windows 11 (I just downloaded 10 and did a fresh reboot with that)- Battery life isn't the greatest, but I wasn't expecting much in that department- So much bloatware, but I guess that's more the fault of Microsoft than HP, since Windows 10 includes all kinds of useless crap (that I spent roughly 6 hours removing)Everything else has been great. If I can just get used to the keyboard (the placement of every key, and the ""weight"" of them), then this seems like a purchase generally worth $880. I'll just have to accept less than ideal color depth (it's not that bad tbf). I wouldn't mind spending a couple hundred more to fix these issues, and maybe have separate action keys that aren't the same as the function keys (since I use those quite often). I might consider that, but I really needed a laptop to work on DAW projects at school and just other things outside my room, which I know this will suffice for a good while.",Consider the downsides,2022-11-04,4.0,R1IJ9VEVHC7C66,AMAXAMA,0.0,Issues:Battery lasts about 1 hourNo lighted keyboard.Feedback:make all connections usb-cmake it sturdier and impact resistantadd touch screen,issues and feeback,2023-07-21,3.0

This is not only opinion, I took some measurements. The contrast ratio is over 1800:1! Most consumer tier computer monitors strive to get 1000:1, and cheap laptops are usually worse, (I have one about 580:1). The sRGB gamut coverage measured about 96%, which is close enough for your eyes to accept as full. This display is objectively excellent for LCD and is absolutely unbelievable for a laptop of this price.It is light and one of the only laptops I've had other than a Macbook Air that can actually be used as a laptop. Like, you could sit with it in your lap and use it and be comfortable. Your neck might get sore, but that's not their problem.The touchpad is one of the best I've used on a laptop that wasn't a Macbook other than the tactile response requires pressing too hard. That makes it difficult to use it for dragging items around in folders, or sizing windows, because you're grinding the surface while trying to move your finger. Maybe I just haven't caught on.The SSD upgrade is not explained anywhere easily found. I installed a Samsung that I already owned and the device wouldn't recognize it. On the Chuwi forums some users were struggling with the same issue and it seems it needs to be a specific type (M2 2280 - not just M2 whatever - I think). Again it could just be me, but I would like it clearly defined somewhere. I have another one on order but with no feeling of certainty that it will work.Update: It seems the SSD slot for a second drive only supports SATA. In spite of the fact that it’s a NVMe slot and another non-Amazon site claims it is the (superior) NVMe, it needs to be a SATA drive if you want it to work.",The praise for the display quality is valid,2022-12-01,4.0,R31CCRZ4AYD0XZ,Mr Bean 57,1.0,"On start up there is some flare at the edges of the screen.  Not noticeable 95% of the time, but still it's there.  Screen and enclosure are very flexible,  not good in my book for a metal case.  The flex seems like a plastic case.  Keyboard feels good and a nice size.  Trackpad works but a very noisy clack when pushed.  Boots up quick, setup very easy, speakers don't sound bad at all.  Screen color is fine for media consumption.  I do like all the ports, and expandability.  I upgraded to 12gigs of ram for 25 bucks with a 8 gig chip here on AMZ.  One reviewer said it was light, well I wouldn't want to carry it around all day. Found my BT mouse in a few seconds, and works on my phone Hotspot no issues.

Purchasing for the Switch has some pros and cons, Handheld, take the experience with you anywhere or dock your system for the big screen. as far as controls, I've always been a mouse and keyboard advocate. That being said I don't mind using a controller for games. Really depends on the game and genre of games. I didn't expect much for controls but if your wanting to play hard core competitivly you might find it a bit annoying. Instead of just closing doors with buttons you have to slowly look side to side then select the door button. I think FNFAF: Help Wanted had the same problem for me. On the bright side it could just me being extreamly particular. I just like the fast quick access for when I was on the PC I was like Sonic on speed clicking/switching extremely fast.Besides the controls and your preference on them, you will enjoy the experience wether your a returning player or better yet, starting for the first time. I almost made it sound like the game was difficult to play with the controls. It's not if you get good enough to predict the animatronics locations.Like I said for the price it's worth a buy. If you you have a PC however, I recommend getting it for that or hell, get it for both. The game isn't demanding at all. I think any PC no matter how old can run the game as long as you aren't on a super old operating system.Hope my review helps. Have fun!",Just as I Remembered!

Worth noting that once you get of the repeats, this console only has 405 games (over 200 less than it's advertising). There are actually less than that, but some game titles are misspelled (numbered differently in spite of being the same, etc.). The manufacturer couldn't even be bothered to alphabetize the game list either. So, while there are actually a number of great games on this thing, you've got to dig through a bunch of random repeats to find the goods.SOME of the games that boast 2-player modes don't actually let 2 people play, no matter which mode you select. There's no save function for any titles. Odd that the system looks like an SNES in spite of having a bunch of NES games loaded on it. And you have to use the reset button on the system itself to exit any game. The right port (not the left) is the 1st-player. The controllers are stiff, and not reliably responsive. The power cable is super short; 2 feet at most. Lastly, some of the games aren't what you think they are (EX: Mortal Kombat is hot garbage).On the plus side, plenty of good games are actually here (even things that look like knock-offs because of the spelling errors, like ""Ninja Gaidem""). It comes with 2 controllers, which is nice. And the system itself is responsive when looking at games, or powering off/on. I wouldn't buy this again, but (awful as it can sometimes be) it's not a complete waste. Your best bet is going through the games list, and making not of what's worth playing, and what number it is in the list (so that you can easily find it).Built-In Games:001. CONTRA 1002. CONTRA 2003.

The remote control buttons for the various functions are not intuitive, so it takes some practice. For us, it took about a half an hour to get to the point where it was doing what we expected it to do. The robot also can operate on gestures and voice commands, although it takes some practice. We still haven't figured out how to get the robot to respond to gestures consistently with the expected action, and voice commands require you to be very close to the microphone on the robots chest. Another thing is the voices - there seems to be different voices used for different actions. For instance, Story Telling mode uses what seems to be a child's voice (also present for some of the songs it can sing), while other responses sound like a firm male voice.On the plus side, the robot can do lots of different things, from dancing, to singing, and telling stories, so it will keep kids entertained for quite a while. I was surprised it was able to drive over flooring transitions without getting stuck or tipping over (at least in my home). The position of the arms are adjustable, and the robot is rechargeable, although the remote requires 2 AA batteries. The best part... There are volume adjustment controls! Most toys like this only have one volume - loud. At least with this, you can ask your kid to turn down the volume or mute it so it doesn't become annoying.Overall, I think it is a fair buy. I found it difficult to use myself, but the kids picked it up rather quickly and haven't become bored with it yet, so I'm happy with it so far.",Keeps kids busy for a while,2023-10-06,3.0

Too complicated! If you just want a turn on and play for a child or for yourself, this is my take of the Anbernic RG 300x. This set offers the big sets of the post-Atari retrogame era: Regular Nintendo (note no Mario games on this at all), Super Nintendo, Nintendo Game Boy Advance,  Sega Genesis and Sega Megasystem, and original Playstation 1. Plus the Neo Geo and the Turbographx/PC Engine (advanced graphics but less popular). You want Red and Gold as it mimics the look of but is bulkier than the Nintendo Famicon Micro.Within this review I point out a few ""user guide"" things if you already own this, if you're like me and new to these handhelds. Like how you need to put in the game chip with your fingernail in the bottom right slot and then the games will load in a list under each emulator (toggle the top brass buttons from settings to emulators then scroll between them).Compared to the Anbernic's RG351P which is very well regarded but $40-$45 more, this RG300x has these advantages: (1) clearer crisper screen of the two devices (though only 3 inches versus 3.5 inches on the 351), the screen is beautiful (2) better aspect ratio to fit the game systems...only Game Boy Advance (GBA) is better suited for 351 ratio (3) only this one has an HDMI port to hook up to a TV, (4) No joysticks on this one--note none of the Nintendo, Sega, or Sony Playstation game systems I listed had joysticks, (5) minor point but only this one places headphone jack on the bottom where it is easiest vs the top, (6) this one doesn't try to do too much--the RG351P and the even more expensive RG351M in metal have more recent game systems, that came after the original Playstation PS1 (like Dreamcast and N64). For me, retro means retro. I'm fine with the RG300x offerings where I can stick to my Sonic 2, NHL Hockey '94, Donkey Kong Country, Galaxian, Super Punch-Out, Grand Turismo, Ridge Racer, Outrun, NBA Jam, Ninja Turtles IV, Ms. Pac Man (scrolling screen or original full screen) Tekken 3, and check out the awesome visuals on Vectorman. Crash Bandicoot, Tony Hawk Skateboarding, Sunset Riders (Wild West), and the funny Waku Waku 7 (on the Neo Geo) (7) now, the menu is much nicer and sleeker on the RG351P. This RG300x has an ugly outdated menu look--you toggle with the brass buttons on the top of the device to get to the emulations menu, then move up down left right to get to the game system you want. All icons look different. All load up easily. There is an arcade icon too with various games but I stick to the emulators.To exit a game and return to the games list within a console, either hit the lit up blue buttons at the bottom of the condole simultaneously, or hit the power button quickly on the outer right side of the device. That will bring you to a dropdown that asks if you want to exit game or resume. Sometimes you need to press one of the 4 keypad buttons to return to the menu. Some games are grouped within manilla folders, 95% are just in a vertical scrolling list. With 3,000 games across many consoles you may want to jot down what # your favorite games are.The Game Boy Advance has a good version of Frogger in the Konami collection game: you'll need to make the screen larger in the display settings of that game (same menu where you can exit a game) since the GBA aspect ratio appears smaller on this as mentioned above.The games of this era are a lot of fighting (Street Fighter series etc.), role playing games (Zelda up through many character based games), and platform with shooting games (Mega Man, Metroid). A lot of those. But you get some pretty unique ones thrown into this handheld on the 64 GB card which you have to insert in youself on the bottom right: various superhero games, a cricket real sports game, Shaq Fu, platform games about Scooby Doo, Barbie, and Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson (the last two you defeat enemies with dance moves or dribbling a basketball). Marble Madness was a fun concept in the late '80s and on this. Some games titles are on more than one system (or ""console"") so you can decide which you prefer. Whatever games you liked are likely on there.It's light. The control pad feels natural controls are not stiff. Comfy to hold. (The good, responsive, soft feel of the keypad on left of screen and buttons on the right is an important and often overlooked part of choosing a handheld--these feel good.) The controls rattle a little bit if you shake the device but they're well made and they are responsive. To power off, preferably use the top brass buttons to change from emulators to settings then select power off (or press the small black power button for 2 seconds on the right side for a quick off).I own a very inexpensive retro console for $25 and it's worth spending more to get something like this (this is still a budget one compared to others...note the price went up $5 since I got mine). Again, the screen is crisp and nice and better resolution than some of the larger screens out there (this boasts a 640 by 480 pixel resolution, the same as the expensive RG 351MP). Some people said the tint is off all I can say is it looks sharp and it's easy on my eyes. Some complaints say that this one uses the same technology or operating system and chip from 2 years ago. I can't speak to that. Others claim they've updated the operating system in this model since it's release: I don't know.I've had this for a few weeks and am happy with it!  Anbernic does a solid job making the games look and play like you remember. As one user said elsewhere, people who ding this model as not going far enough or pressing the envelope don't understand the subtleties of retrogaming.","Best handheld for NES up through PS1 (screen crisp, affordable)",2022-12-08,5.0,RTODG217K6NNJ,Ren C.,0.0,"if you like to mess around with emulation systems this is an okay option, as long as you love the gameboy micro. this form factor is really uncomfortable due to the sharp corners... i really wanted to love it, trust me. but i ended up returning it. its a really awkward device and you really gotta want to just have it as a collection piece otherwise youre prob gonna regret getting it.and yea out of box experience is not very good due to poor os.",Good for Tinkerers,2023-07-06,3.0

Some stories have characters you love to hate.  A good example, in this book, is ""Ice Maverick.""In the game world of Starship Crusader, he is a ""tactical expert"" with armor and lots of weapons.  In the real world the players are from, he is a professional gamer who knows how to shoot things to get the high score.  Gamers may want to BE him, if only because when an ""NPC"" tries to give a boring info dump he shoots them.An ""info dump"" is a long and sometimes boring speech that tells the player things they need to know in order to understand the game.  The more a player needs to know, about something like an alien planet, the longer it takes.  Gamers aren't known for their patience, but Ice Maverick does this early in the book, when the reader is still trying to understand things.  Ice is apparently used to single player games, and ""Maverick"" thinks he can win the game all by himself.  Because the reader is trying to win a game with multiple players who have to cooperate in order to win, ""gamers"" see this behavior from the outside.I won't promise it will change their behavior, but it is a clear example of how stuff like this is not always good.Another point that may be easier to miss is what happens when Ice Maverick has to steer a ship that is in danger of crashing into an alien planet.  Because the programmers of the game went to the time and effort of creating a whole planet and filling it with aliens to interact with, it is considered a ""scripted event.""  Ice Maverick assumes that the flying ""mini-game"" was just to determine how much damage the ship took.  The crash was ""part of the game,"" and not his fault even though he was at the controls.You have to tell kids that they are smart, because it is easy for them to give up if they assume they are just born dumb.  Video games can be good for this, if you can solve a puzzle in the game then you do possess some intelligence.  This boost of confidence can help with other activities, outside of video games, but parents should be aware of ""scripted events.""  Some fantasy games are based on fantasy novels, which follow ""the heroes journey"" through ""the darkest hour.""  We like reading about heroes who rise from the ashes to overcome impossible odds, though it can be harder to set up in a video game.  Players can ""keep on trying"" by hitting the reset button and trying to fly the ship in such a way that Ice Maverick never crashes into the alien planet.  However, the programmers of the game worked hard on the planet and the aliens, and they want ""keep on trying"" to mean ""fix the crashed spaceship.""This is the kind of thing parents need to talk about with their children, but is also something that parents can only talk about if they play the game themselves and watch their children play.  This book makes the process easier, though you still need to read it a few times to learn about all the choices available.  Fortunately it is a good book that can be fun for both adults and children.","You are the lizard on the cover, ""fun for both adults and children""",2022-05-02,5.0,R3C8NGNWE84H61,Helen,0.0,When I say a problem it doesn't mean it's a bad book.But when I found the thing out of place(the bottle)I couldn't find the right page,A problem,2021-07-16,3.0

Following the same format as volume 1, the end result is good but something of a mixed bag as well.Picking up in 1996 where volume 1 left off, Kent tells the story of console releases and the people behind them.  He liberally sprinkles in quotes from key players and an occasional journalist.  These are entertaining and provide insights you're not going to find just anywhere.  Really good stuff.  And you got almost 500 pages of that kind of material.  So that's a good thing, right?Well...There are numerous problems.  First and foremost is ... where are the games?!!?  Oh sure, SOME games are mentioned but ""The Ultimate History of Video Games"" - not Video Game CONSOLES but Video Games - should have coverage of LOTS of games.  Where is Assassin's Creed?  Where is Uncharted?  Where the heck are all the RTS games that dominated PC gaming for several years?  And on and on and on.  There are TONS of key games missing here.Next is that, without stating it, the book stops with the PS3 generation - sort of.  Lots of stuff is talked about from after that generation - but not the PS4 or PS5, not the Xbox One or Series S/X.Next, where are the games for mobile platforms?  Kent talks about the PSP and DS but completely ignores phones.  If you accept the arbitrary cutoff date of ""the PS3 generation"", this is still not acceptable.  The original iPhone was released less than a year after the PS3 but doesn't exist here.  Ditto for Android.Where are all the indie games?  Not here.Where is Steam?  Steam was introduced *3* years before the PS3 yet goes without mention here.The PSN Network was hacked in 2011 but goes unmentioned here.Speaking of PSN and its competitor, Xbox Live, the rise of online gaming is pretty much ignored here.  Oh, they're discussed but only as a feature of hardware platforms rather than the global communities they've become.Next, there is somehow a lot of rehashed material here.  The formation of Electronic Arts and its ""album cover"" boxes was discussed in Volume 1 - why is it included again here?  Same thing with Activision.In addition, Kent has a somewhat strange selection of sources.  He's got a lot of key players and industry insiders and then remarkably few journalists.  There's a ton of quotes from N'Gai Croal, a video game journalist I've never heard of previously - perhaps because he wrote for Newsweek rather than an actual video game publication.  Croal is quoted over and over and over with his words being given way too much importance.  Kent also makes sure to tell us what Croal's favorite game is for no apparent reason.Finally, we get 30-some pages on movies about video games.  I suppose that's OK but seems out of place here, especially considering the huge number of, you know, GAMES that are missing.At the end of the day, Kent's Volume 2 is a highly entertaining read that will end up frustrating almost as much as it entertains.  There are just so many things ignored and missed that, unlike Volume 1, this one does not live up to its ""Ultimate"" title.  I do recommend the book, just be forewarned.p.s. Don't believe the ""592 pages"" information.  The actual book ends on page 530.  The acknowledgements and index take you to 562.  And there's a few pages of intro.  Being very generous, there's barely 570 pages here.  Realistically, it's more like 530.",A good but flawed follow-up to an all-time classic,2021-09-16,4.0,RIQM8VJZE984J,Marc T.

More out of a sense that I owed it to Rolfe than to actually wanted to see it, but when it arrived I must admit I eagerly popped it into the BR player and stared the film and was not disappointed.  The movie is great if you like ""The Nerd"" and adds some new characters to the mythology that I didn't mind.  If you like the AVGN webseries and indie films, you'll like this.",It's a gem if you like the source material,2023-07-09,5.0,R1AUO5O3VOGJH9,RetroJunkie,5.0,"I wasn't expecting too much when I ordered this very pricey Blu-Ray. I knew from comments I read on YouTube (and even from James Rolfe himself) that it was a low budget film with cheap, phony effects etc. But wow, I don't think I've EVER seen THIS cheap of effects in anything I've watched since the original Land Of The Lost (such as a toy car that's supposed to be the nerd van they're driving, and a doll that's supposed to be Mandi). But cheap effects isn't my biggest complaint.My BIGGEST complaint is the actors and story. Where did James Rolfe dig these people up? The actors caused the movie to feel boring. James' friends Mike Matei and Kyle Justin (singer of the AVGN theme song) only made one cameo appearence near the end of the film. Instead, there's this super dainty guy (Jeremy Suarez I believe) who's the nerd's sidekick, so-to-speak (and totally does NOT fit in). This should have been Mike Matei (or someone portraying Mike Matei). Then there's Mandi (Sarah Glendening) who plays the reporter, who pretends to be a nerd. Which I actually liked better when she had the glasses on. Overall, I didn't mind her. But then again, WHO IS SHE?  Even though (in the web series) I can't remember the nerd ever having a female guest star. Which he definitely should start doing.I don't mind the story about the nerd trying to find the Atari dump site with the E.T. cartridges. That was a cool concept. But nothing went the way it should have. I lost my interest about half way through the movie.  Everything just got really confusing and plain STUPID!  The movie should have been based more on the AVGN web series. But it had little to do with it. The evil Death Mwauthzyx alien robot-thing that tried destroying the earth (or whatever the heck he was doing) should have been R.O.B. The Robot. I mean, who the hell IS Death Mwauthzyx?Even though I had little expectations, the movie failed even my smallest expectations. Oh, and the green, rubber, alien character they made to portray E.T. (or, Eee Tee) looks flat IDIOTIC!Bottom line: It was good seeing the nerd playing in an actual fan-funded movie. But his web series is MUCH funnier and more entertaining. Even giving this 3 stars is rather generous. Many people say the movie ran too long. But it's only 114 minutes (an hour and 54 minutes). Basically the standard length of any movie. And yes, there are hours and hours of bonus extras, such as cast interviews, behind the scenes, bloopers, deleted scenes etc.You have to be very easily amused to think this movie is great. I can't believe how many people rated this 5 stars. I'm a huge AVGN fan, and I own all of his DVD's. But this movie was a real letdown.",Failed My Low Expectations.

The same issue with the joysticks, but I knew that ahead of time and plan on replacing them.I want to give an A++ to this seller. I have never had an Amazon seller be so responsive and work with the customer. The seller has been outstanding to work with and communicates and responds very quickly.  Everything about this experience, except for the joysticks, has been great. So, I am upping my star rating to 5 stars...because the joystick issue is an easy fix for me.UPDATE ON THIS UNIT: First, the joysticks that come with this are not very good. So, I spent an additional $30 on a SANWA JLF-TP-8YT Original Joystick. Link here from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRQMWEQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI installed this joystick and now the unit is absolutely perfect. Seriously, this is like playing the arcade game now. If you get any variation of this console...I highly recommend you at least change out the main joystick with this SANWA joystick...you will not regret it.----------------------------------------------------------------------I would have given it 5 stars, if it had better joysticks! (2 stars for bad joysticks)I have one of the expensive HyperSpin builds with an X-Arcade Tank Stick joystick/trackball combo, that I've had for years. I wanted something that was ""all in one"" and didn't require a separate computer to run on. So, I did a lot of research and digging and came up with this 13,000 game non-WiFi Pandora 30s console.First off, let me say, what the 30s means, I have no clue, but to my surprise, when my console arrived, mine is the 40s, I assume that is newer.Pros:I absolutely love this console! It has every retro game I can remember playing as a kid and many that I had forgotten about. If you want a simple, ""all in one"" box, this is it. The games all play very well...I hadn't noticed any tearing, lag, or slow downs of any kind...it just works and plays.CONS:THE JOYSTICKS ON THIS BOX ARE TERRIBLE...LOL! They do work and you can play ALL games with them, but when you get serious and need to make that perfect move, at the perfect time, these will not handle it. To test this out, try playing Pac-Man, you simply cannot navigate quick enough.Yes, the seller has suggested hooking up a USB controller...but that is NOT why I purchased this ""all in one"" box. I want the True Arcade Joystick play, not using a PS2 controller.I paid $159.00 for this 13,000 game unit. Was it worth it...YES! Would I recommend it...YES! Is it fun...YES! Does it bring back memories as a kid...YES, YES YES!Again, the ONLY real negative I can give this is the joysticks. I may look into getting some better joysticks and swap them out. These are no where near the quality of joysticks that are in the X-Arcade Tank Stick, but also look at the cost there as well. This box doesn't require a computer to run. It is simply ""plug and play"" and that's exactly what I wanted, minus the bad joysticks :)Again, the included joysticks will play all games you want to play, but they will also get you killed in a tight turn, jump, or move. Bummer there.","Great little Arcade system, with not so great joysticks. (UPDATED JOYSTICK & A++ Customer Service)",2022-09-18,5.0,R1F01CO16AY21,Amazon Customer,14.0,"When I bought this unit, I was looking to scratch my nostalgic itch for videogames of the 80s and 90s. From that perspective, this product worked! Lots of games, plenty of entertainment potential.But then, all the issues began to pop up. First, the unit does not always power up. When it doesn’t, it makes a funny humming noise, almost like it’s trying to start, but can’t. After it’s finally on (sometimes after 5-10 minutes, sometime I’d just give up), the unit kept resetting itself, even mid-game. For every 30 min of play time, I would have to deal with one or two resets. Very annoying. That alone made playing impractical.Second, the built-in speaker is a hassle, not a desirable feature. The sound quality is mediocre — which is fine, I’d want to run the sound through the TV anyways. But if you lower the volume on the speaker, the volume on the TV goes down too! Well, turn off the built-in speaker, right? That option was unavailable in the settings. So, I either played without sound or with the little speaker blasting for all in the room to hear.Third, and maybe this is just user error, I could not change the screen setting to fit the picture better on my 42-inch, 16:9 format TV. The image fits horizontally and chops the top and bottom of the game screen. In addition to losing “screen real estate”, the image gets more pixelated because it needs to expand to fit side-to-side. Playing Outrun was impossible, I couldn’t tell if that giant pixel on the horizon was a car coming, a bush, the beginning of a curve ahead…Fourth, the buttons and directional stick are very “click-y”. This is a personal thing, but I dislike loud buttons that go click-click-click all the time. It’s distracting. The clicks were often louder than the built-in speaker itself.Lastly, I could not make the unit work with my computer monitor. I tried all the connections available, nothing worked.In the end, I had to return the product. I didn’t want to do it, it had potential, but there were just way too many issues to deal with. I spent more time troubleshooting cable connections and surfing the settings menu than actually having fun playing games.Having it at home for 2 weeks made me want to look for a good product, since I really enjoyed the idea of playing some old-school arcade games at home. I guess I’ll need to search a bit more.","I wanted to like it, but…",2022-10-06,2.0

If you want to play street fighter, king of fighters, or other similar old school arcade games, this system will facilitate that without too many issues.

The game count is significantly over rated. There are several copies of at least a dozen games in the game list. The same game may show up over 10 times in different parts of the list. Some are named incorrectly also.Bottom line; if you're looking for this to perfectly play all the included games, or have a full list over 3000 games, you'll be disappointed.

I knew what to expect going into this in terms of it's repetitiveness and short mission profiles but how many other titles offer you the chance to fly a fully modeled Huey Hog in Vietnam? I figured I'd give it a try. I was terribly disappointed.The concept was brilliant. The weapons platforms are authentically modeled, uniforms, unit markings, and B /D model Huey's are amazingly rendered. Flight dynamics are difficult to master. The point is to make a flyable helicopter for a gamer yet they really went overboard on all the actual flight dynamics for rotary wing aircraft. There are enough principles of flight in this game to give you an absolute migraine. Helicopters by their very nature dont want to fly, unlike an airplane you literally have to fly them all the time but why make it impossible? Navigation is dead reckoning, line of sight just as it was before the days of VOR and GPS. Finding where to go is a task in itself if you get past Dynamic Rollover or Blade Stall.The developers actually included a mission editor so that you could create your own scenarios but they provide no instruction on how to edit this. Unless you look in the install folder you wont catch this gem. Even then it's fairly useless as there is no documentation. The file extensions from a Western perspective are nonstandard. Most developers here dont write .tex files. Skinning and modding are therefore nearly impossible to develop which is probably why no Western sites are devoted to it. This isn't surprising given the game was done by Eastern European developers. European programming standards are different as they prefer open-source over there. This is a shame as nearly every major Assault helicopter unit in Vietnam could have been skinned based off the gunships and Slicks in the game.My biggest gripe? I'd like to say the developers that brought IL2 and Silent Hunter III must have really shifted all their resources to their other delayed and anticipated title T34 vs Tiger, a WW2 tank sim because the team that did those amazing combat sims stopped short on this one. Not from a graphics perspective although to me the AI on the ground could be better rendered as well as more intelligent. As a release it is extremely thin in many ways.You need to have something of a beast of system to even run this game.

Games such as SMB1, SMB2, SMB3, Goonies (the first one), Elevator Action, Contra, and so many more. Just as with those old ""in-1"" cartridges, there will be duplicates and those that have variants of the same game. There are some annoying things. When the handheld is turned on, it blares this music at medium volume. So be ready to press the volume down button on the side right away. The device starts up with language choices, it defaults to ""CHINESE"" as the first language (Spanish and English are the other two). Unfortunately there is no way to change this default. I like the form factor of the handheld. It is small, pocket-sized, and easy to recharge with standard micro USB. The buttons are decent.

There aren't many settings to adjust, and it resets each time you turn it off. It's a nice way to pass the time. It has a separate gamepad, but that doesn't work for me. I've tried all sorts of combinations, but it never works. The instructions merely warn not to take the thing apart, which is fine. There isn't a whole lot to this. It works fine when connected to a TV, but the gamepad still doesn't work.Charging is simple with a micro-USB (also the gamepad's port). But there's no on-screen battery monitor. I won't be playing this for hours to exhaust the battery. I haven't scrolled through the entire list to see what the 666 games are. The instructions don't have a list, and there's no way to page through them quicker than holding the down button.The gameplay is fine. The direction pad is effective, as are the buttons. This lil thing is loud, though. Every reset literally resets the device, so the volume returns to the max level. There's no way to be discreet with this. It does not have a headphone jack, and I doubt using an adapter would work because the device screen went black when using the composite cord to connect to the TV.",Pocket-sized Nostalgia,2023-03-17,3.0

I’ve recently gotten back into star wars and had been thinking of this game a lot, as i the original lego star wars game on xbox 360 as a child, i wanted to replay as an adult on my switch! The game has been so fun and definitely a great way to kill some time, there’s been the occasional glitch here and there, but from what i have read online that seems to be kinda normal, nothing a quick google or youtube search can’t help tho! As this is a lego game, it certainly isn’t as star wars as it could be, seeing as this is moreso marketed for kids :) i did notice some storyline details were changed from when i played the original game on 360, but that’s probably because of violence or something, all in all though, great game! I love the freedom of traveling to different planets and exploring!",Yes!!,2023-09-06,5.0,R2H2BTQR67FYD3,Carson M.,0.0,"As a dedicated fan of both Lego games and the Star Wars franchise, I was eagerly excited to dive into the epic Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga on my Nintendo Switch. However, my high hopes quickly turned to disappointment as I embarked on this galactic adventure.The first aspect that struck me was the graphics, and unfortunately, not in a positive way. The visuals were surprisingly lackluster and fell far short of what I expected from a modern Nintendo Switch game. Character models lacked the level of detail I had come to anticipate from previous Lego titles. The environments, though recognizable from the iconic Star Wars movies, felt flat and uninspired. It's disheartening to see such beloved characters and settings presented with subpar visuals.But the most frustrating issue for me was the lack of camera zoom control. While previous Lego games allowed players to adjust the camera's zoom to suit their preferences, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga strangely omits this crucial feature. As a result, I found myself stuck with an awkward and often disorienting camera angle that made gameplay an unpleasant experience. After just 30 minutes of playing, I started to develop a headache due to the constant shifting and restricted view.The core of any Lego game lies in its ability to offer enjoyable and immersive gameplay, combining humor, puzzles, and action. Regrettably, the camera issue greatly hampered my ability to fully engage with the game's challenges and explore the world. It hindered my enjoyment and overshadowed what could have been an exciting journey through the Star Wars universe.On the positive side, the game does manage to capture some of the charm and humor typical of Lego titles. The iconic scenes and characters from the Star Wars saga are there, and the story arcs remain intact, albeit in a blocky form. Additionally, the game offers a vast amount of content, encompassing all nine mainline Star Wars films, providing players with an extensive journey through the saga.However, despite these bright spots, the fundamental issues with the graphics and camera controls severely impacted my overall experience ending in a return. As a long-time fan of both Lego and Star Wars, it pains me to say that Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga on the Nintendo Switch falls short of expectations. I sincerely hope that future updates and patches can address these critical shortcomings to make the game more enjoyable for all Star Wars enthusiasts, but for now I don't recommend buying.",A Disappointing Galactic Adventure,2023-07-29,2.0

While the price between the two was fairly similar (this bike was roughly $35 cheaper) the juxtaposition between the general quality and ease of assembly was pretty overwhelming.My wife's bike went together like a dream, and even though I'd been a bit skeptical when we purchased it, I was really impressed with the quality of it. Based on that success, and hoping to find a good outlet for an exuberant 3 year old during a cold winter, we bought this for our daughter.To preface things, I actually really enjoy assembling things, and like to think I'm pretty good at it. This bike though, was more or less infuriating to put together. It does come with several tools included, which at first seemed like a nice touch. Sure, they were cheap, the wrenches were just punched out of sheet metal, but I appreciated the idea, and started the assembly process without bothering to grab my own tools first.As it turned out, of the included tools, not a single wrench actually fit the nut it was intended for well enough that you could even use it. They were either too small to even fit around, or so big that the slightest bit of torque would just end up spinning the wrench around the nut. I was literally able to tighten things further with my fingers.In that same vein, many of the included nuts and bolts were so thoroughly the wrong size, that they would have been unusable without a lot of extra little bits and pieces that I luckily had lying around. As the most notable example - the bolts for attaching the ""body"" of the bike to the crossbars that sit on the floor came with capped nuts. Obviously, you want to use those for a bike you're building for your child since they're nice and rounded, instead of just leaving the raw ends of the bolts pointed up for your kid to step on, but they can only be tightened down as far as the cap allows, so it's important the bolts are the correct length.The bolts included were almost a full inch too long, which meant that even if you put everything together as tight as it would go, the crossbars were still so loosely attached that the bike may as we'll have been duct taped on. I had to use a stack of washers for each bolt in order to make it work.Had it been for anyone else, I would have returned the thing right then, but no daddy is about to tell his 3 year old daughter that the bike she's been waiting for all week is a piece of junk and she has to wait for that to get straightened out... You figure out how to make it work, and since I had the pieces I needed anyway, I did.Finally got the thing together, despite a slew of other little adventures with poorly fitting parts and flat out terrible design, and while I suppose that technically, it functions, I have nothing good to say about it beyond that.There were no reviews available when I bought this, but given our previous success, I took a chance. This would be easily judged as terrible on its own merits, but having had such a great experience just a week before with a similarly priced bike for my wife, this easily ranks as the worst purchase I've made in recent memory.","Horrible quality, incorrect parts",2014-06-21,1.0

After much debating and reading the review by  Eirick Skywalker  I settled on this. Let me say this was a very good decision. My mother whose near 80 loves this. Her and my father used to play Burger Time endlessly in their free time. Now she is back to playing and enjoying the game though without my father. I’d highly recommend this system to anyone looking for the 80’s. I played it a whopping 15 minutes and never experienced any issue even using 2 extensions on a single controller to get the reach needed for mom to play. She’s been playing and enjoying the game with no issues either. Just be attentive and order the extension cables as the cables with the unit are rather short.  I’d recommend 2 sets one set for each controller. Now the game console itself is small and in a good way, it takes up no room literally it’s about 6 inches wide and long and 3 inch tall. Perfect for a non cluttered look, except the extension cables which who cares about that minor issue, its the 80’s. The controller itself is a bit small, but very responsive. It’d be an easy 10 star item if the controller was just a bit bigger. Hats off to the designer for bringing the 80’s back in a very positive way. As it’s been used now for about 40 hours, I have not had the have to mash all buttons syndrome to get to any of the menus. Nor have I have seen any game listed more than once as others claimed. They are single copies and placed in order of action, puzzle, and such, arranged nice and neat. I ponder on a few reviews if they bought the item from another seller mixing that up with this unit? Or if there was an older unit with those issues, as this one does not have any that they claimed.",This is an amazing little unit.,2023-08-26,5.0,R3NBQWFM6YS9PQ,Shashoanna Bell,4.0,I just got mine yesterday and I hooked it up I was so excited to play it.The only thing I don't like is that it has game I haven't played.

Maloney,3.0,"First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).It was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.The first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.And there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.I made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.There's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.Also found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.It should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.I haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.I recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.And as my age indicates, fun for all ages.Oh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.","A startling, occasionally disquieting virtual reality experience for all",2022-10-17,5.0,R218B7559CFBHT,Pedro Rodriguez,1.0,"Pros:- Fairly Immersive.- Amazing experiences.- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.Cons:- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.IMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.I have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.Seeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.Be considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.",Amazing But..,2022-04-02,3.0

The last ones I purchased only lasted about 6 days (halo obstruction,  broken parts, bad design, etc).But I'm really excited about these. They feel sturdy. Nice and thick in areas you know others have had weaknesses,  and the fact that they come with rechargeable batteries was a great selling point for me. I spend way too much on AA's, so im excited and hopeful.I just finished putting them on the controllers, and important TIP!! *PUT THE HALOS ON FIRST!* The button top of the black grip goes OVER the halo.  This information was not in the instructions book, because the halos aren't in there. So, please save yourself some time and frustration.Once I had the Right and Left situated (look at the bottom of the Grips, not only do they have R & L, but also colored red (left)  and blue (right) ) getting everything set correctly was pretty easy.Another tip incase you miss it in the booklet, a solid red light means it charged, and a blinking light means charging. A little different from the Red (needs charged) and green/blue (charged) that many people are used to, but simple to learn and remember.The book also explains why you will only see your batteries charge to 80%. This is perfectly normal, and yes, they are fully charged. The batteries just differ from the originals and the headset doesn't compute that.They don't come with a charging block,  just the cord, so you can use your VR block, or your USB port on your computer.  Might even be able to use the headset port too if you have an external battery for your VR, but that's a test for another time (and not exactly practical lol)So far these are extremely comfortable, and the halos actually took a bit of meticulous placement,  but im looking at that more of a plus. This makes me feel like they aren't going to fly off like the original ones. You have to (or should) make sure the edges are folded over the controllers all the way around. Takes a few extra minutes, but if it works the way I hope, it's well worth it.Another plus is there is ZERO interference with the triggers. Alot of the other Grips were too close (overlapping) to the triggers and they would get stuck. With these, smooth as butter.On the first day, I am going 5 stars. If this has any issues at all, I will revisit my review.  But if you're reading this and it was posted weeks or months ago, everything has met or passed my expectations.","Got today, so far I'm thrilled!",2023-04-12,5.0,R2QENBZHPF8Z8I,Lem,0.0,"The controllers are comfortable to hold and the convenience of not having to pop open my controllers every time they're low on battery is nice. The strap around your hand also isn't digging in, so it doesn't cause discomfort. I have one major gripe about this and that is it eliminated the wrist strap but the knuckle straps hold on fine so for the most part that's ok. I guess another gripe i have is the adjustment line for the knuckle strap can sometimea get in the way. A way to sort of clip them in place to keep them from flopping around would be nice. Zyber customer support however is not so good. I had to order a replacement through Amazon after waiting over 2 weeks upon recieving my order, and still to this day, no response from Zyber when my first set of grips had the left charging light malfunctioning. The second set arrived and the left light worked",Zyber customer service sucks but the controllers are good,2023-09-12,3.0

I'm no expert in terms of emulator systems but have had some experience with all-in-one game systems and handheld multi platform gaming consoles in the past. This, however, is miles above those cheaply made, flimsy systems that are essentially 90% 8-bit games or knockoffs of popular media. This system allows you to run a variety of emulators which allows you to play several style games from a wide span of several decades. You can play classic SNES games, motion based Wii U games and a little bit of everything in between. There is a bit of a learning curve if you've never played an emulator but essentially what it does is allows the device, the RG405M, to replicate playing on a variety of Gaming consoles.All of the hard work is essentially done for you from the get-go as these emulators have been around for years but are already downloaded and fully activated on the device. All you really need to do is download your games from reputable, legal sites or copy them from your existing physical versions to create a portable game system that you can use virtually anywhere! And even that may be something you might not even have to do as the system posts and impressive ton of games already downloaded and ready to go once you turn this on. I looked through the list several times and, unlike similar systems that claim they have thousands of games that are all in one, this actually has no repeated games in their game lists. Some systems have hundreds of games already preloaded into the RG405M and it just takes a matter of finding which one is your favorite and with in a matter of clicks you're good to go. Games like pokemon, several Mario games, a number of Zelda games and a surprising number of Kirby games are already installed. My favorites are definitely the Crash Bandicoot games for the Game Boy Color and advanced emulators.Buying this over getting a brand new unit that has nothing installed is a no-brainer as it takes away 99% of the guesswork of jumping into emulators and playing them wherever you want. Now downtime is basically just more time to play as you can switch from Wii games to PlayStation to Sega Genesis, etc. games all within a few clicks of a button. Initially, my first unit arrived with some damage to the screen and I was really bummed but after contacting customer service, we reached a resolution to have the device replaced and the model I received is flawless. Took no time at all to reach a speedy resolution and the communication was excellent. Really felt like the seller was trying to make sure my purchase was a good one. Can't say enough about this unit and the seller in general as it allows me to relive Nostalgia from gaming as a kid, literally putting the power to play on my favorite units all in the palm of my hand!",Great system and customer service,2023-08-26,5.0,RFQIR2V0VIHZ7,Danielle Thornton,2.0,Great build great design but needs better quality control the R button began to malfunction after only 2 days everything else was fine but the quality control needs to be better handled,Amazing but needs better Quality Control,2023-08-11,3.0

The Pimax Portal stands out as one of the most unique devices in my collection. It's also just plain fun to play around with.What makes the Portal special? For one, the raw oomph. As of August 2023, this is top tier among Android handhelds that are suitable for emulation. (Some newer phones will outperform the Portal, but most of these have aspect ratios that are less than ideal for emulating older consoles.) Of course there are new consoles released seemingly every week, and the Portal will surely be surpassed in power sooner rather than later.That's OK, because power isn't all the Portal has going for it. It's a handheld that, despite the unmistakeable influence of the Nintendo Switch, manages to feel inspired in its own right. Other handhelds have done detachable controllers, but Pimax's magnetic holsters are a neat take on the concept; it's remarkable how satisfying it is to hear the click as the magnets snap the controllers back into place  A 4K screen is overkill for emulating retro games but is darn pleasant to have around for general Android usage. There's also a micro-HDMI *in* port on the QLED version enabling the Portal to be used as a tiny external monitor, should you be inclined in that direction. Most importantly ... in just another couple of months, Pimax will be releasing a VR headset that allows you to turn the Portal into an Oculus Quest competitor.  It's a brilliantly versatile device.That said, the Portal isn't perfect. The build of Android 10 it ships with is a little too locked down for my tastes. Things have gotten better as of a week or so ago; Pimax now lets users set a custom launcher. But there are still some peculiarities. For example, the familiar notification area Android users expect when swiping from the top of the screen is nowhere to be found. This means it's impossible to check on the status of your downloads in Firefox, for example. Hopefully these quirks get ironed out over the coming months.Despite these niggles, I have no qualms recommending the Portal to people who can afford the (admittedly) luxury price tag. It's an amazing tech toy.",Superb device for retro gaming,2023-08-31,5.0,R5HQKDAL0EJJ2,Gaurav Bhola,9.0,While it really looks and feels great; it's probably not worth the price.

For that reason, I've added one more star!",STUCK with ITS CONTROLLERS,2022-11-23,4.0,R1AL2FUWACCNTU,S. McGrath,1.0,"This is most definitely not for beginners at all. It is extremely complicated to figure out. After weeks of research, I am very confident that it does not have Android on it. It has an auto save function that seems to work on 8 & 16 bit games. Like NES & SNES. But it doesn't seem to work on Playstation games. The controller often needs to be mapped. And no matter what you do, it doesn't work properly for certain games or systems. For example Dreamcast Sonic is not playable. Because the directional pads do not work. You cannot make Sonic move. I literally downloaded every version of Sonic for Dreamcast I could find. Same result. So I bought different controllers. None of the controllers I bought would pair to the system. It would say it was connected, but it didn't work. So I wasted money on different controllers. It says it has 45+ emulators? Sure, but a lot of them are things like the Commodore 64. Which is essentially a very old computer system that requires a keyboard. This emulator doesn't have a keyboard. So I can't play those even if I wanted to. Wants me to type in a command. Not gonna do it. Can't. And a lot of the systems are handheld systems. Game boy, Game Boy color, Game Boy advance, Nintendo ds, Neo Geo pocket, Neo Geo Pocket color, Game Gear. Speaking of the game gear, it does have every Sega system from the Master System to genesis, 32x, Sega cd, Sega saturn, and of course the dreamcast. With Nintendo you're going to get regular nes, snes, Nintendo 64, and that's it. I'm kind of surprised there was no GameCube. The N64 did not have Donkey Kong 64. That kind of surprised me. I had to install it myself. Which brings me to the SD card. They pretty much maxed it out. So even though you can add stuff to the SD card, you're very limited. You're going to get the original PlayStation and nothing else. I'm surprised there was no original Xbox. For the most part, I find the PlayStation games tend to work pretty good. Before example, I was playing Crash Bandicoot and I beat several levels and when I went back to it the next time it had not saved anything. I almost want to return this. But then I think to myself screw it. At least I can play these games if I wanted to. It's better than nothing. It would be a lot cooler if you could actually save your place. For example, I have an old Arcade NES emulator. And I also have a SNES emulator. The SNES also does NES. Either one of these systems, if you press select and start at the same time, it brings up your save, load, or quit menu. And it will allow you to literally save whatever spot you are in those games. Which is absolutely wonderful for something like the original Mario game. Because not only can you start where you left off, you can load different lives and different locations. With multiple saves in each game. I was really hoping this system would do the same thing. One last thing. On the box, it does say that it has android. When it absolutely does not. On the box, It also says that the system itself has no system. This thing comes with two USB ports. One USB port is for your controllers. Both controllers will work with the One USB dongle. The other USB port is for a USB to SD card adapter. You plug in your SD card to the USB adapter dongle. And then you plug that into the system. Without that, there is no system. The entire operating system is on that micros. And the game box itself does not even have a MicroSD input natively. I found that very odd. After doing some research it appears that this system is actually a banana pie. Which is a cheaper raspberry pi. But even most cheap banana pies actually have a MicroSD slot input. So I'm not sure why they did this. Almost all emulator systems have a slot built in for an SD card.",Claims to have Android 9.1 but does not.,2023-06-12,2.0

I'm pretty happy.Update: nearly a month into owning it, the save has completely stopped working. Controllers randomly flip (1st person will become 2nd, and vice versa) sometimes in the middle of playing. Does it with both 1 player games and 2. Controllers will also randomly turn themselves off, needing to be turned off and back on 2-4 times before reconnecting. In the end, it feels like a waste of money. Now I have a grey box with two controllers that just sit on my entertainment center not doing anything. Its so bad I consider giving it away, but don't want to unload a broken thing on someone else.Final edit. 3*, but only because I have enough time to figure it out (because it was too late to return). Seller was unhelpful with questions, but I figured it out. Eh",Resist the impulse. It's not worth it,2021-04-15,3.0

Who would have though a game like CoderBunnyz could teach coding, but it did and does!  Now, CoderMindz continues in the tradition of CoderBunnyz and delivers a fun gaming experience for young and old while teaching principles of artificial intelligence.  Like CoderBunnyz, this game can be modified to be very basic (get from start to finish, no obstacles) to a quite challenging game of designing a program (using the playing card decks and function cards) to help train your robot to move from start to end.  The very basic levels can be played by younger audiences (the age 6 recommendation) but the advanced levels do require a somewhat older mind approach.  The nice thing is this means the game can grow with your learner.I used CoderBunnyz with my 5th grade students with much success and student enthusiasm.  I bought a class set and for many months, it was our Tuesday morning warmup activity.  I'm now teaching 6th grade and do not have the flexibility of being able to modify a daily schedule.  When I heard about the game I was anxious to check it out.  I hoped it would be at least as fun as CoderBunnyz. When I received my order, I opened it up and it, like CoderBunnyz, is very professionally designed with quality game pieces, game board and cards.  I invited four kids to try it out.  I used the online videos to introduce the game play, and turned them loose!  They loved it.  There was laughter, there was thinking, and the time was over for the kids before it had barely begun.  In the middle of the game, one boy said, ""I definitely would play this at home!""The way the game is structured, anything is possible, meaning, the ""obvious"" winner, may not be the one who finishes if they get ""zapped"" back to their start position.  This happened twice in the first game.  In the second game I utilized the recognition tokens that have to be gathered.  Students enjoyed the strategy of placing their neighbor's markers.  (See rules!)  Though the rule book doesn't suggest this, like CoderBunnyz, I believe you could have both advanced and beginner players play together at the same time using the appropriate obstacles and challenges to their individual levels.  (I did not try this though!)All in all, I would recommend this game.  If you have played CoderBunnyz, this game will make sense more quickly with some of the same concept of token movement.  But, if you haven't, that's fine, too.  The games really do stand alone from each other.  I would encourage you to give CoderMindz a try.  Even if your children/students are not that interested in coding, the game play is still fun and challenging!

The camera fails to recognize tiles half the time, and either doesn't recognize when you pull the lever to run your program or it thinks you're constantly pulling the lever so it won't stop trying to run it. I've tried all kinds of things - at first I thought maybe the lighting in the room was a factor, but had the same problem in multiple locations. I thought maybe my kids clothing was too close to the color of the tiles and may be confusing the image recognition, but even if they stepped completely out of the frame it had the same issue. So much potential to be a great product but with all the bugs we end up giving up after ten minutes because the kids and I just get mad at it.",Buggy software makes it practically unusable,2023-08-06,1.0

Meanwhile, the game MAKES you do things with precise timing like block / dodge, but is lagging and inflexible with your ability to position yourself.And that's my thoughts after 10 minutes of gameplay. Can I finish this? Probably. But when I compare it to titles like Tears of The Kingdom which are fun to play for hours, this just doesn't have it.

Fr. (RevRev) Rick,0.0,"Game of Thrones Blu-ray setI purchased this set to replace my Season 1-6 and Season 7 and Season 8 DVD sets. In what follows please accept my apology if I have recalled something incorrectly. I found the set excellent and worth the price of admission, but I’d like to describe some “interesting” features of the set.Realize that it is a huge set that includes 33 discs. When my set arrived I found that at least one-third (yes, about a dozen) of the discs were loose in their cases. I don’t know if this occurrence is a comment on the less secure Blu-ray cases (to me, they seem less so than DVD cases), a poor packaging for shipping job, or unusually rough handling during shipping. One corner of the slipcase cover was slightly “accordioned” but not very noticeable. All discs looked fine on inspection and all episodes (I viewed them all) plus all features (that I have viewed this far) have played without error.Obviously the video and audio quality far exceeds the DVD set that I have and that alone (plus having all eight seasons in one enclosed package) was worth the purchase. But read on, if you wish…The weirwood tree animation at boot up of each disc is cute though it sometimes doesn’t get a chance to actually animate each time (your mileage may vary depending on your equipment.) But the momentary static “languages available” image at the start of each disc seems a bit unnecessary and maybe even a little irritating, but perhaps some may need it.Drop down “house banner” menus are neat but they are translucent and so is the text on them so they are not easy to read over the moving video montage that is presented behind them. Also, not a big deal, but they retract after 60 seconds if not acted upon. Of course, you can open a banner again, but don’t be surprised if it disappears after you return from grabbing refreshment.All the original DVD extra bonus features provided are present along with several new features. Most are indeed “behind the scenes” video features, but some are text and still animation images, some are voiced-over by the characters (not sure these were provided by the actors or not) and some are just text you walk through and read. Nice extras but not as good as the bonus video features provided.The extra 3-disc bonus set is excellent with a two-part “Game of Thrones Reunion” feature, Anatomy of a Scene” (for Seasons 4,5,6,7), “Behind the Scenes” (for Seasons 1, 2, 4, 5), “Inside the Visual Effects” (for Seasons 1-7) and “Season 7 Deleted Scenes”. There are similar features scattered throughout the sets and I have not viewed them all…yet.The “Conquest & Rebellion” feature on disc 3 of the Bonus Features set is long (ten chapters) and yet quite interesting, though consisting of slightly animation-enhanced high quality static images and character voice-overs. (Again, perhaps not done by the actors.) Note that once you select a chapter the history continues to play through the following chapters unless you interrupt it (that is, you can’t play “one and done”.) I found it useful to have subtitles on during the feature. It gives a fairly thorough overview of the 300-400 years of history before the Game of Thrones timeline began.Starting with Season 4 and after “Dolby Atmos” audio support is available, although I don’t have the equipment to determine the difference. But the enhanced audio is certainly available. The Bonus Features set does not support Dolby Atmos (who cares?)The ability to walk through the Episodes menu and select any episode from the entire season then be prompted to insert the correct disk if the selected episode is not on the current one is a nice little feature. It is not available on the Season 7 and 8 sets for some reason.I am sure you will enjoy this entire Blu-ray set of Game of Thrones!",Impressive Blu-ray set with MANY bonus features!,2023-09-18,5.0,R3N16PU1IXFGQC,Saint Nicolas Cage,70.0,"First of all, I won't be wasting anyone's time complaining about season 8 (which I haven't even seen yet), or anything else.  This is just a review of the 4K box set.I never got to watch a good deal of GoT, so pretty much everything is going to be new for me!  I only got to see the episodes on my PC, where I was lucky if the videos reached 480p.  I gave up after season one because it just wasn't enjoyable watching them like that.  So when I got my PS5, upgraded my receiver and added Atmos speakers, I started looking into 4K Blu-rays.  Thanks to Films At Home's review on YouTube, I discovered this and I just HAD to have it!The 4K picture quality is phenomenal.  With so much happening in the snow and in the dark, watching this with HDR will blow your mind away!  The Atmos tracks are a very good addition, but not overly impressive (at least not yet, as I'm still in season one), and are still a part of an already an amazing presentation.  The box artwork is great, and the slipcover has an embossed dragon wrapping around the side.Each disc has commentaries, but I've heard some have more than that, and there are 3 bonus Blu-rays of separate special features.  It also includes a code for the digital edition, which expires on December 31st, 2022.  Others here say that theirs had already expired last year, so maybe they've updated it.  Just make sure you realize that the digital copy is only in 1080p, not 4K.  There's also a small booklet with a list of the episodes from each season, and a bit of nice artwork.However, there is one major problem with the set, that I can't believe the designers got away with.  Most seasons each have four discs, but instead of having a swinging tray in the middle, they stacked two discs on top of one another on each side.  Everyone knows that doing this is a HUGE no-no, as it results in discs being damaged, especially when trying to remove them from the spindles.  I highly recommend getting a CD/DVD wallet to put them in right away.  Another problem is that the audio doesn't default to Atmos, even if you have it enabled on your receiver.  You need to go into the audio settings on each disc every time you want to watch one, and switch the playback to Atmos.  Not a huge deal, but it is a little annoying since I don't always think to do that.  Or maybe that's the way it is for everything with Atmos....I'm still fairly new to this.Another problem with the discs I just noticed after putting them into a wallet is how they're labeled.  They're black, with VERY small & dark copper text.  You basically have to hold them up to the light in order to see them.  Not a huge problem, but very bad design.Fortunately, I've learned from past bad experiences with a few box sets that you absolutely must check every disc, not just for scratches or duplicates, but also to make sure they actually can play.  You need to make sure that they can reach the main menu, and maybe even try playing a few seconds of an episode.  It's very time consuming to sit in front of the TV, swapping discs in and out for almost two hours, but it's worth it.  I'm saying all of this because I had to return my first order, as the third disc of season six didn't read at all.  I never would've found that out until after the return period.  From what I've read here, this seems to be a somewhat common problem with this set.  Also, season five's case was smashed on the top right, but those discs were fine.When I got my replacement, I immediately noticed that season one's box doesn't lock at all, and the sheet with the digital code wasn't secured in place like before.  It was loose and bent.  I can't be sure, because I have no need to redeem it, but I have a feeling that someone pulled a fast one and already did.  Also, the first discs of seasons three and four take a very long time to load, but in the end they do work, so I'll be keeping this set since everything else plays fine.All in all, if you're a GoT fan with a 4K Blu-ray player, there's no reason not to get this!  Yes, it's a bit pricey, but it's worth it.  Just don't forget to check the discs.",4K COMPLETE COLLECTION BOX SET REVIEW (NOT EPISODES).,2021-02-13,3.0

I could just play SF2 on PSP via emulation but having a licinsed handheld dedicated to SF2 is way better. The handheld offers the Sega Genesis versions of SF2 Turbo and Super SF 2. You can have great games on there but what's most important is the buttons and d-pad. Do they work good? Yes they are pretty good. There's a 6 button lay out just like on the Sega Genesis controller. The d-pad is a bit mushy but after breaking it in, you'll get used to it. You got a home and start button right above the 6 action buttons, so be aware you may press it by accident when in a sticky situation. There's also a power switch, brightness and volume button along the top of the handheld. You can play the handheld with the option of using a USB-C (which beats the purpose of the handheld) or using four AA batteries for power. In my opinion the only downfall for the handheld is that it's not a rechargeable handheld and you'll have to buy AA batteries to power it on when on the go.

But from what I hear, you can add your own games to the SD card. I need to learn how to do this bc I hear it's very easy.... You can also delete game roms you don't want as you scroll through games while the unit is on. The amount of games on here is insane. I would have gone nuts if I had this back in the day when I was a kid!!  I would say that that 99.9% of all the games for the systems listed above play perfectly. You can also rename the emulators by editing the name. It takes 5 seconds and very easy to do. I renamed all of mine so that they look and read like what they are. Lynx, Nintendo etc.....  The speaker is so loud!! Some might like this a lot! Pretty cool but I always use headphone when playing.It is tricky to navigate at first, but once you start to do it and learn what button does what it becomes very easy. I heard some people really complaining big time about this and i don't know why. I am not tech savvy at all and new to all of this this and it only took me a short while and now it's extremely easy to jump from one game and system to another. Also using save states etc....  Trust me, if I can learn it and I am bad at this tech stuff, so can you. I like it!The screen is a nice size, but it would be perfection if it was 3.5""THE SCRATCH RESISTANCE GLASS SCREEN IS THE BEST SCREEN OUT THERE . **** ALL HANDHELDS SHOULD HAVE SCREENS THAT ARE OF THIS HIGH QUALITY MATERIAL!!!!!! ( I don't understand why this isn't the norm).CONS: [ I really wanted to give this RG300 5 stars instead of 4 bc it's almost there!  I have to keep it real for all those who really like retro games and are looking for the best ]- The volume wheel is just a bit touchy and can be tricky when trying to adjust volume up and down. Not a deal breaker at all, but volume buttons would be so much much better. It would just be nicer even if it had a better and less tricky/ smoother volume wheel.- The shoulder buttons and two buttons in the middle are very clicky and can be heard. * Especially the shoulder buttons. I know that they are high quality in regards to being long lasting and wear and tear. Is there a better option that can withstand years of use? This might be annoying for someone who is trying to sleep next to you while your gaming or just trying to relax next to you.-The stock user interface that comes installed is nice, but could be more attractive and organized so that it flows and looks a bit better. Not a deal breaker at all being that it's all there, but it would be nice to have it look a bit more attractive.- It would be nice to have someone on the team do a quality control and take something like 3 weeks to  inspect the roms so that the customer who purchases this is confident that all game roms provided for each system are flawless and sound good. The customer should not be like, ""DANG! I really wanted to play Checkered Flag but the one that on here does not work. Now I have to go and find a better rom that actually works!"" If you provide it for a paying customer, it should work.Overall, I love my RG300 and think that it's an amazing product. I am so stoked. Everytime I see it there on my night stand I feel like a kid again. This thing is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S. If the very minor cons listed above where touched up and you slapped a 3.5 screen using the same high quality scratch resistant material, I would not have a problem giving the RG300 a 5 star rating!!! Being honest, I also would be willing to pay more money for it!",Amazing!,2023-07-21,4.0,R1WR67J58B22VE,C. R. Vaca,38.0,"Originally was using my phone to play my roms but wanted something physical to feel buttons and wasn't ready to shell up 100+. This little - about half the size of the original gameboy - is pretty cool. I really wanted it for Gameboy and SNES and this guy runs these perfectly! I had several issues running any of the sega ports and the ps1 roms ran absolutely terrible, do not buy this for the ps1 emulation. The sega stuff was hit or miss and even some of the roms pre installed for the GB, GBC, GBA, NES and SNES where pretty messed up and wouldn't load but lucky for me they weren't games I was too attached too, except for clayfighters but I have my own rom on my pc that works miles better that I may try and install on to this little guy later. Last two issues, she runs HOT, extremely HOT to the touch when running some of the GBA games and PS1 titles, I had to put it done a few times because it was just uncomfortable. But all the systems I mention before that I wanted it for - GB, GBC, NES & SNES minus the GBA - never got the system hot enough to annoy me. The speakers on this guy are also hit or miss, when they work its great but every now and again the sound just cuts off or starts really high. I got around this by tapping around the speaker and after a couple light taps the sound would pop back into place. There are a ton of excellent games, emulators and even skins to choose from - I haven't tried the music, video, or image play back because I have a phone for that stuff but if I do ill update this review. Oh! Lastly, the battery is Meh at best, running GB and SNES the battery stays pretty healthy but load up GBA, Gamegear or PS1 and BOOM! There goes all the charge in like 40mins. For the price and what I use it for, i'd say its a pretty good starter, all the games I already enjoy where preinstalled and work flawlessly. Its perfectly travel sized for a pocket, side of bag or just leaving near the restroom. I do think I'll be upgrading to the Anbernic RG351V in the future just cause its a looks slightly bigger and more sturdy, or just wait till my steamdeck shows up, but for now this is good little handheld emulator with some problems but if your like me and really just wanna play some GB, GBC and SNES games while waiting for Nintendo to port them then yeah i'd recommend this guy. This transparent edition is super cool looking too, glad I picked it over the standard grey version. Before I forget, the system uses ""select and start"" pushed simultaneously to open the emulators menus during gameplay on most emulators BUT NOT ON THE GBA and GBC emulators! For that you need to push the right shoulder button to open up the menu and access the scaler, quality, save states or exit the app. Just a friendly tip since the booklet didn't mention this anywhere. If they were to add one extra thing, I'd love a ""favorites"" section to mark the games I play most, cause is it a pain and a half scrolling through the hundreds of games in ABC order just to get to Super Mario land 2. I've included some pictures for scale compared to some nendos and my other handhelds and phone. Ok Im done now.",Excellent little handheld for starting out with some small annoying problems,2021-09-04,3.0

I'll break this review into a few parts.Firstly, can't complain about something that looks decent and costs under $50. If I had more freedom of choice I might have gotten one of the sale prints but the event determined the need for subdued. Received it in two days, giving me enough time to wash it before wearing.Secondly, the fabric is a slinky kind of knit, not too thin but not too heavy. It was tolerable outdoors in triple-digit-heat-index weather. It had great movement too; I didn't feel at all restricted climbing into and out of a tall vehicle, and while walking/standing all day. For me it required a sweater indoors, but the funeral parlor was admittedly kept cold. After washing and drying, I hung it up and didn't need to iron; it also showed no wrinkles at the end of wearing all day.Thirdly, the fit. I'm short with an Unfortunately Sized bust; I have to fit everything to that part of the anatomy and hope I can make enough alterations elsewhere to not look horrible. This is a true wrap dress and that aspect helped me in getting a decent fit at waist and hips. The armholes for me gapped a little; the shoulders are a little too tall (admittedly my shoulder-to-bust distance is shorter than most manufacturers cut and I always have this problem). I wore a black bra underneath to minimize any undergarment peek but I'll need to make a formal alteration at some point. Sleeves would have solved this problem but I didn't want to go with longer sleeves in the warm weather. I also needed to add two safety pins: one next to the button for security — my button held fine but I didn't want to tempt fate based on some experiences in other reviews here — and one where the neckline overlapped as leaning forward caused the front to gap indecently open. A person with a smaller bust might not have as much of a gap problem but the more generously endowed may consider the mighty safety pin. A small snap added to the overlap would also solve the gap problem.Overall I have no complaints as this did everything I needed it to do, and comfortably enough to consider ordering the dress in another color.","B on fit, A+ on fabric",2023-08-18,4.0,R33NO5LD7WG99K,Debbie,0.0,"The dress is heavier than I thought it would be.

It is the same rather thin fabric. But I have determined it is good in hot weather. Between the larger size and very dark colour, the wine red dress is totally opaque. (I felt the lighter coloured leopard print had a potentiel to show my bra, depending on the colour, especially if it was any tighter over the chest. It didn't, though.)Regarding the colour, please note that it is more burgundy than red, cool and deep, almost shading into aubergine. It's all right on me because I am a former brunette (my hair is now naturally grey), but the colour might be a bit dark and heavy on a blonde or redhead. Of course, it depends on your taste, but I thought the colour looked much lighter and redder in the pictures than it does in real life.I really think L was my size, but I do appreciate the additional looseness in the hips and waist areas afforded by the XL, as well as the additional length. I am 5'10"", and the L is an above-the-ankle dress, when the XL is ankle length, in flats, which is how I will mostly wear them. The top part is quite loose. The arm holes are deep and loose and the bust is loose as well. I have broad shoulders, a very large rib cage and a medium-sized bosom (C cup), plus biggish arms (think middle-aged swimmer), so it is unusual for me to find clothes are too big on top. I think you should bear that in mind for sizing. If, like me, you want the dress to be non-clingy around the waist and stomach, it may be challenging to get a good fit unless you have a very full chest. Indeed, I think I will try this with a padded bra next time.The price point is sort of middle-of-the-road and so are the dresses. I think they will hold up well; others I had in this brand did and I have washed and worn the leopard dress maybe four times now and the wine one once with no noticeable changes whatsoever. They are not thrilling dresses, but they are serviceable and handy, especially in a hot climate (and I live in Africa). They could have been better, and I am surprised by the fit, but overall, I am happy with my purchases and will wear them often. I like that the skirt is a bit wider on the bottom and doesn't have a slit. It is easy to walk in (I have a long stride and can't stand a skirt that hobbles my gait), and the fact it doesn't have a slit means I don't have to worry about a slip showing underneath.Leopard Print LThis dress is one I am going to keep, but I think I will mostly wear it under a jean jacket. This dress has several minor issues. The material is thinner and more polyester-like than expected. It is not see-through, however, despite the light-coloured base. The beige shade is deeper and warmer than expected, which may be nice for some, but is not very good for me (I have grey hair and was expecting more of an ecru, it's almost a tan). Above all, it is clingy without being tight. The material just sticks to any lumps or bumps. I could literally see the outline of the elastic on my panties. Not an indent, because they're not tight, but the actual top and bottom of the elastic. And it pointed out the little pooch and the little pouch in my midsection. Thankfully the skirt is a little looser, it's an A-line style, so I didn't see anything on my lower hips. I admit I haven't tried it with a slip and might play around with different underwear options. If I were a Spanx wearer, it would be lovely, but I don't do that... if I can find a cool shift to put underneath, it might smooth things out. We'll see...Update a week later: This dress is growing on me. The colour is all right. The thin fabric makes it cooler in this stifling heat. I haven't found a shift, but I've worn a half slip. You can see the little line around my waist, but it's not the end of the world, as you can see, I'm obviously not going to be on any catwalks any time soon. Great dress for wearing around the house, and will probably look cute under my jean jacket in cooler weather.Further update: tried it with loose tap pants and it was all the dress needed for modesty and very cool and comfortable.",The fabric is a tad bit thin... size up if you don't mind it being loose in chest and armpits,2022-06-08,4.0,R3OOQFZN895K79,Evette Shaffer,0.0,Dress fits true to size but smells strongly of incense.

I am a 48 DDD and the stop is snug. I worry when I wash it, it may shrink or get tighter.  I will try air drying the dress to reduce shrinkage. Nonetheless, I like the empire waist and the fabric breathes well but is not translucent.  The length is nice - the hem sits just above my ankles. I am 5'3. I like that the pockets are higher up than my other dresses for ease of grabbing my phone or keys.  The pockets are large enough to hold my iPhone 13 mini, Edge wallet and keys.  A full size iPhone might be a little to big for the pockets. I thought the flower print was white, but they are a light beige color.  Not bad, but I wanted to mention it. If I purchase another, I'll order a 5X because I prefer loose fitting clothes.",Light and Comfy,2023-08-18,4.0,R3D4RMN2OMS1UX,J L,52.0,"I ordered the orange dress in both XL and 2XL because I was not sure the XL would fit.  I am 5' 7 and somewhere between 175 - 185 lbs (I have not weighed in a while).  The 2XL was much too large and too long, and it looked like it was a return they packed up and sent out again.  I think 2XL would be better suited to someone who is perhaps 225 lbs.The XL is really a bit too long, although a knot at the end of the dress would help if one was wearing flats; otherwise, one would need to wear at least a 2"" heel to make this length work without touching the ground as one moves around, bending, getting in and out of vehicles, etc.  It almost touches the ground whilst I am standing straight up.I think a Large would be a better for someone my height and weight in terms of both length and width, BUT I fear a Large would be too tight beneath the armpits.  The XL just barely feels good beneath the armpits.  The neckline on the XL is good.  There is plenty of room across the bust, the waist, and the hips in the XL.  I am very tempted to order a Large to see if it would not be too tight beneath the armpits, but then there is the CRUCIAL issue of sheerness to consider.I think the pattern/colour is absolutely beautiful, but as other reviewers before me have said, the material is very, very thin, exceedingly thin.  You can hold the dress up in front of you and look through two layers of it and still see everything on the other side quite clearly.Having said all this, if the dress was only $15-$20, I might not have qualms about keeping it, but with tax this dress cost nearly $40!!!  I expect a heck of a lot better material for $40.  At least one other reviewer described the material as being like a bandana.  I could not agree more, and not a high quality bandana at t that.  I am so sad.  I love the colour and pattern, and I would order 2-3 more colours if the material was a lot nicer.  As is, this material could be twice as thick and still be very thin.So, the XL is going to have to go back as well.  I just cannot fathom spending this much money for something this sheer and flimsy feeling--without sufficient undergarments, this dress is obscenely thin!  Not only that, but I would have to buy either a slip and/or pantaloons or tights to wear under this dress, which would push the cost up by another $20+.  That would be a minimum of $60+ dollars to make this dress wearable anywhere but at home alone.  Think about that for a moment.  With appropriate undergarments, the cost to wear this dress would be at least $60.  That is outrageous and NOT a good value AT ALL.If they used a much better fabric than this, I would happily pay $40 (with the tax) for one of these, but not for something this sheer.  I would be shocked even to pay $20 for it.  $15 would be more in line with the quality and with what you would have to do to make the dress wearable.  I am going to go to Walmart or Target or some such store to look for something.  Some items from China are very nice quality, for example, Apple products, but most of the stuff from China is overpriced grot, and these dresses are a prime example of that sad fact.  I can go to higher end department stores and find much higher quality clothing on sale for this price.  The only reason I do not do that is because I no longer enjoy shopping in stores.  If I did still enjoy it, I would go to the mall regularly and watch for good sales on much better quality clothing.I do NOT recommend these dresses unless you can get one for $15.  I doubt one of these would last one whole season if it were used and washed at least 2X per month.Oh, one last thing to note.  This dress will require hand washing, line drying, and a cool iron because it wrinkles very badly.  If you wash this in the washing machine with mild soap on the gentlest cycle, I think it would come apart in as little as 2-3 washings.  It may come apart in as little as 2-3 washings even if you wash by hand.  This is a HIGH MAINTENANCE dress that even with great care is not likely to last even one season.",EXTREMELY THIN MATERIAL --- Needs Slip/Pantaloons/Tights to be Wearable --- High Maintenance,2021-10-14,2.0

It fit exactly like a 1x would normally fit me (I ordered an XXL). I love the peacock blue color. For me it's a great shade without being too obnoxious.However I had two big issues with it.#1The v neck was a huge problem for me. It showed major major cleavage, to the point were it was insanely inappropriate. I could not wear it without an undershirt because it showed so much. However I do have a very large bust line (42 DD in a full coverage bra) and I could see how that was part of the problem. I don't know if the cleavage would be that intense with a smaller chest. There is a little button you can fasten to make it more modest. On me this button aggressively popped open with the slightest movement and I eventually stopped trying.  This left me with a silver button on one side of the neckline that wasn't horrible, but just looked weird.If you have smaller boobs or don't mind showing cleavage (lots of it)  than this probably wouldn't be an issue for you. For me, it was too much.#2 The dress has a sewn in slip. It's one of those that is shorter than the rest of the dress. It didn't seem to matter at first but when I sat down the slip rode up immediately. Every time I moved, it would ride up more. It was really bad. Like seriously.... REALLY bad. I tried to pull it down, but it was nearly impossible while sitting and was also just embarrassing.There was no way to try to fix it and look classy. It got so bad that I eventually had to grab a scarf (thank God I had one) and cover my legs with it. At one point the entire slip was bunched up around my waist and not covering even a millimeter of my legs. Since the top layer of the dress is see through this was a huge embarrassment. If it wouldn't have been for the scarf I would have had to leave.Maybe it's because I move more than the normal person, or am somehow a freak...? But wearing this dress was a horrible experience for me. I'm not willing to spend $50 on a dress that needs multiple add ons (undershirt, extra slip, blanket)  to make it work so I sent it back.",Loved Until I Wore It,2023-06-28,2.0

I felt amazing and looked stunning in it, which was surprising since I usually prefer fit and flare styles. However, my excitement to try it in pink was met with disappointment. The darker colors lack the supportive lining that the white one offers, and it significantly affects the fit. The light pink/dark pink combo has some lining at the top half, but the dark pink portion doesn't. I really wish they included the lining in all colors because it makes a huge difference in how the dress fits, giving that snug and comfortable feel. I'd happily buy the white one again, especially for brides or anyone looking for a lighter color, but I'd steer clear of the darker shades due to the lack of lining, which, in my opinion, makes them feel like entirely different dresses.I’m 5’4” 120lb wearing a size small","Gorgeous Dress in White, but Disappointing in Darker Shades",2023-09-13,4.0,R39NZ2LCG41T2Q,Tia,0.0,The silhouette and color are cute and I’m glad I got it but it’s very see through.

This dress had everything I was looking for.  I had a wide variety of prints and solids to choose from.  Based on the reviews, I ordered a size up but ended up reordering and keeping the one 2 sizes up.  One size up had the waist up too high, a snug fitting top and the neckline was too low.  2 sizes up has the waist at my waist and the top of the dress is looser fitting so the  neckline is higher up.  The dress is a cotton/polyester blend.  It's comfortable to wear, launders well (I machine wash and hang dry).  The fabric is thick enough that it is not see-thru and no slip is needed.  Given the price, I am not expecting the dress to last forever but so far there is not sign of pilling and it has not faded or gotten too stretched out.  Not a perfect summer dress but a good summer dress.  I just want to add that the dress material pills badly .  After wearing one 3 times, one side is so badly pilled I can no longer wear it.  So take that into account when buying- carrying my purse on my shoulder apparently caused enough friction to cause the damage.  So this dress definitely requires the wearer to be VERY careful when wearing it.  I'm going back to all cotton dresses- no more blends.  Very disappointed with how quickly this dress became unwearable.",Lightweight Summer Dress,2023-08-27,2.0

The material is also very prone to wrinkles, so you will need to steam or iron this dress every time you want to wear it. The other issue (for me) is that this dress has no liner and is rather thin, so if the light hits you the right way it's going to be see-through.All that being said, if you don't mind putting in that extra effort for this dress then it's for you.

I ordered the 'pink/blue' and not sure the colors are really pink, it seemed more peach, but I don't care, I really felt like I was having a good clothing day.  I'm 5' 11"" and the dress was surprisingly long for me.  Bust is 36E and there was a snap perfectly placed so I didn't feel like it was too low.  With the sleeves, and length, I felt comfortable wearing this to work.I agree, this dress is incredibly figure flattering.  It is a true wrap around dress and the ties were long enough that I wasn't going to feel like I didn't have enough to go around my body and properly tie the dress.  I wore the dress to work, and like many other reviewers, received many compliments.  One of my coworkers couldn't believe this was from Amazon!The fabric:I didn't feel like it was very breathable, so if you live somewhere with high humidity, I don't know what that translates too.  I wore a slip; I believe this also helps with the fact the wrap around would open all the way to your hip if it is/was windy.  Walking in the wind, my slip (knee length) did get flashed, but the fabric slid back in place quick and easy.  Also, all things considered, my dress wasn't incredibly see through.  But I wasn't standing outside in the sun to find out either.  To post the review it asked about stretch, and the fabric doesn't stretch at all.  I do feel their sizing chart is true to size, (Pretty Gardens chart) but because this is a wraparound dress, it would probably be forgiving.Side notes:I washed mine in a laundry bag and hung it up to dry.  The ties are very long and my cat was going crazy.  He was chewing on the end of one before I was able to get it away from him.I'm very happy with my purchase!  I would recommend this dress.",Very happy!,2023-07-28,4.0,R2EU4N8DK8E7AJ,ann,0.0,I liked the design but the wrap around was confusing and not flattering at all.

This dress is absolutely stunning!I am hourglass shaped, 5'7 155 and wear a size 10 or 12 in a skirt or pants. I thought about getting a large - but at the last moment selected a medium. It fit perfectly! Very forgiving in all the right places - flutter sleeves, tie at the waist for definition (and the waist isn't too high like other dresses on here!), layered ruffles, but not frumpy - the slit makes it feel updated and modern.Some info - yes, it wrinkles, but is very easy to iron using steam setting. I ironed it on the bed at the hotel in 10 mins, no problem. The waist is a little fitted, so you're likely putting this on over your head (just for gals who like to step into a dress).I had no problem with the snap coming open. It is slightly low cut, but you could always layer something underneath to fill in the ""v."" There is a liner, so if the dress blows open a little, no worries at all, you're covered to just above the knee. I was walking down a boardwalk to the wedding ceremony and had many compliments - I think this dress is really flattering and flows nicely as your walking!The dress is flowy, like the store photos show, BUT not light chiffon, as it may appear - it has some substance to it. I was at an outdoor wedding in a forest where it started at 75 degrees and cooled off in the evening - it was perfect for this event, I threw on a wrap.

The fabric is synthetic, but nice to the touch. It is thick and soft. But then I tried it on. What a weird fit! It was perfect on my butt. The nice, thick fabric hid panty lines and hip bulges. But it went downhill from there. It was tight across my tummy, making it look much bigger than it actually is. Then it was really loose on my waist, across the back, and under the arms.Sexy vamp dress: Because of the weird fit, the only curve the dress accentuated was my pot belly. Yikes! But the big problem is the slit up the left leg. I knew it had a slit -- I saw it in the pictures. But I didn't appreciate that it isn't really a side slit, it is a big huge gap that comes all the way up to about three inches below my panties. While a little side slit would be fine and flirty, this dress is basically open in the front almost to my crotch. Sweater dresses are for cold weather, they don't need to be ventilated.All in all, it looked ridiculous on me. It might work on someone with a different figure, like a much bigger chest, who doesn't mind the gap in the front.

Idk if it's made that way or if I received one that someone had worn, stretched out, and then returned but it's very noticeable. I think for the quality it's pretty over priced though :( I paid almost $50 for this dress and it looks rather tacky since you can see through it. I understand a certain amount of sheerness since it is white but this was way beyond what I would expect for the priceI was ordering this to wear for my rehearsal dinner for my wedding.

I love that they are cotton, and because they are made in China, they run slightly small. I am a medium/large. I always order XX large because I have Fibromyalgia and need loose fitting clothes or there is pain. I absolutely LOVE these dresses. They definitely are cotton, and because of that, they tend to shrink a bit during washings, hence the XX large. They are the most comfortable clothing I own. I live in these dresses. Some have complained the colors aren’t as advertised. I have probably 20 of these dresses and in every color. I never found the colors to be anything but perfect. Even after many washings, every dress holds the color. The other reason I buy so many of these dresses, is because, for the price, there is nothing better on the market in cotton. I get up and wear them all day long and change into another one and sleep in it. Many times, I get up, throw on a pair of leggings, and am out the door. Quick and easy. I wear sweaters that match the dress/legging combo and a cute pair of boots and honestly? I get more compliments even from strangers, than anything I have worn in my life.My favorite is the black and cranberry colored dresses, but I have the green, the purple, the gray, and the white dresses. Warning - the white dresses (one short sleeve, one long sleeve) are DEFINITELY NOT cotton material. I can tell. All the others are cotton. Also, I bought a couple of the flowered dresses and they also are not cotton. I have MS and especially, in spring, summer and fall, I sweat a lot. So, I have already given the non-cotton dresses to the local used clothing store except I kept the white ones. For summer.I don’t know why, but the fit is exactly the same on each dress I buy. They fall just low enough on the neck to be a bit flirty, but still hide the rashes I get from autoimmune diseases especially in spring and summer when my many allergies flair up. They have a flattering slightly high waist fit that even looks wonderful on my 70 year old body. Because they run a bit small in the bosom area, I can get away with wearing cotton sports bras and it looks exactly like I am wearing a regular bra. They have wonderful deep pockets below the waist line for my phone and keys. I like that they hit below the knee to hide those pesky rashes. I would love NOT to wear the leggings, but those rashes and old legs just aren’t flattering. But you can dress these dresses up with different things of your own style. If I get compliments on these dresses at my age, you KNOW they are flattering to the figure!I would definitely recommend these dresses to ANYONE with skin issues or pain issues, or even healthy! If I can make myself feel fun and flirty in these dresses, someone without health problems should be able to wear these dresses in the shorter version, with short sleeves! Or, if you aren’t into the new trendy barely there new styles, these are perfect for you! I originally got them as pajamas because I can’t stand wearing anything on my legs at night but needed something warmer than just a long sleeve t-shirt. They sort of morphed into becoming my all day clothing because they are so comfortable, they are well made, they are all cotton which I have not been able to find in any other dresses as pretty as these under $100!! These dresses, for the style, the comfort, the true to color, well made and cotton, are the BEST clothing I have ever bought. And the price cannot be beat anywhere. I have looked and looked. They hang perfect and even have a swing to them! I cannot speak to the size, but every single dress I have gotten fits the same every time. A bit too big, but because of the superior styling, for some reason, they do not LOOK too big. I am 5’5” tall and weigh 150 pounds. But what is strange? They even fit me when I was 240 pounds three years ago! So, the most versatile, comfortable dress I have ever bought. I just bought the new color, gray/blue. Hopefully, it will be cotton!! I hope these dresses stay around for a long time. But I have so many now, I think I am set. One more thing. Others have said they were a bit see-thru? Not any of the dresses I have bought can be seen through. Including the white ones. Maybe I am just lucky, but these comfortable, stylish, well fitting dresses are pretty much all I wear these days. Try one! Like I said, I have tried hundreds of other dresses, tunics, etc. over the years. But I keep coming back to these dresses all the time. Tried many others, but loose fitting in any other style in cotton I have bought have looked like I am wearing a sack at two to three times the price and the colors have never been as nice as these dresses! I might be old, but I am still vain! 😁",These dresses run slightly small and are made of cotton.

It is the same rather thin fabric. But I have determined it is good in hot weather. Between the larger size and very dark colour, the wine red dress is totally opaque. (I felt the lighter coloured leopard print had a potentiel to show my bra, depending on the colour, especially if it was any tighter over the chest. It didn't, though.)Regarding the colour, please note that it is more burgundy than red, cool and deep, almost shading into aubergine. It's all right on me because I am a former brunette (my hair is now naturally grey), but the colour might be a bit dark and heavy on a blonde or redhead. Of course, it depends on your taste, but I thought the colour looked much lighter and redder in the pictures than it does in real life.I really think L was my size, but I do appreciate the additional looseness in the hips and waist areas afforded by the XL, as well as the additional length. I am 5'10"", and the L is an above-the-ankle dress, when the XL is ankle length, in flats, which is how I will mostly wear them. The top part is quite loose. The arm holes are deep and loose and the bust is loose as well. I have broad shoulders, a very large rib cage and a medium-sized bosom (C cup), plus biggish arms (think middle-aged swimmer), so it is unusual for me to find clothes are too big on top. I think you should bear that in mind for sizing. If, like me, you want the dress to be non-clingy around the waist and stomach, it may be challenging to get a good fit unless you have a very full chest. Indeed, I think I will try this with a padded bra next time.The price point is sort of middle-of-the-road and so are the dresses. I think they will hold up well; others I had in this brand did and I have washed and worn the leopard dress maybe four times now and the wine one once with no noticeable changes whatsoever. They are not thrilling dresses, but they are serviceable and handy, especially in a hot climate (and I live in Africa). They could have been better, and I am surprised by the fit, but overall, I am happy with my purchases and will wear them often. I like that the skirt is a bit wider on the bottom and doesn't have a slit. It is easy to walk in (I have a long stride and can't stand a skirt that hobbles my gait), and the fact it doesn't have a slit means I don't have to worry about a slip showing underneath.Leopard Print LThis dress is one I am going to keep, but I think I will mostly wear it under a jean jacket. This dress has several minor issues. The material is thinner and more polyester-like than expected. It is not see-through, however, despite the light-coloured base. The beige shade is deeper and warmer than expected, which may be nice for some, but is not very good for me (I have grey hair and was expecting more of an ecru, it's almost a tan). Above all, it is clingy without being tight. The material just sticks to any lumps or bumps. I could literally see the outline of the elastic on my panties. Not an indent, because they're not tight, but the actual top and bottom of the elastic. And it pointed out the little pooch and the little pouch in my midsection. Thankfully the skirt is a little looser, it's an A-line style, so I didn't see anything on my lower hips. I admit I haven't tried it with a slip and might play around with different underwear options. If I were a Spanx wearer, it would be lovely, but I don't do that... if I can find a cool shift to put underneath, it might smooth things out. We'll see...Update a week later: This dress is growing on me. The colour is all right. The thin fabric makes it cooler in this stifling heat. I haven't found a shift, but I've worn a half slip. You can see the little line around my waist, but it's not the end of the world, as you can see, I'm obviously not going to be on any catwalks any time soon. Great dress for wearing around the house, and will probably look cute under my jean jacket in cooler weather.Further update: tried it with loose tap pants and it was all the dress needed for modesty and very cool and comfortable.",The fabric is a tad bit thin... size up if you don't mind it being loose in chest and armpits,2022-06-08,4.0,R3OOQFZN895K79,Evette Shaffer,0.0,Dress fits true to size but smells strongly of incense.

The prompt delivery ensured that the package reached me within the expected timeframe, allowing for a smooth shopping experience.

The belt came in a well-designed box that provided protection during shipping. The sturdy packaging ensured that the belt was not damaged or compromised during transit, which is crucial when dealing with delicate items such as belts. The attention to detail in the packaging reflects positively on the seller's commitment to delivering a quality product.While I did not have the opportunity to utilize the belt personally, I regretfully returned it due to the similarity in color with another belt I already owned. However, I can imagine that the CHAOREN Ratchet Belt would have been a stylish and functional accessory for men.

If you’re thinking about buying this dress, DO IT! I have such a hard time finding nicer dresses that are still somewhat trendy, for a plus size girl. But this dress did the trick in every sort of way. I bought three of these dresses to try on for a wedding I'm going to. I bought the Jacquard Blue dress, the Velvet Blue dress, and the Floral Multi dress. And I truly loved all of them. I am returning the two blue dresses only because they were a little on the fancier side for the wedding I’m going to, and the all over floral one was more casual wedding looking. I referred to the size chart specifically for this dress, and I'm glad I did, because I did have to size up, especially because of my bust (I’m normally a 2x and sized up to 3x). The blue floral one was the most constricting, but yet it still did have some stretch. The velvet and the multi floral one had a lot of stretch to it. So you can definitely move in this dress. I also feel it is decent quality for the price point.For size reference I am a 44D bra, around 230lbs and 5’7”. I went a 3x in all and they fit just right. The multi floral one came a little looser/stretchier so that’s another reason why I’m keeping that one.Buy the dress and rock it!",BEAUTIFUL Dress for Curvier Bodies,2023-09-09,5.0,R8ES9TA8ESR59,Melissa,2.0,"I absolutely loved this dress the day it arrived.

The day of the wedding, I put the dress on (never even used the zipper, just pulled it on over my head (both when I initally tried it on and when I was getting dressed for the wedding). Before leaving the house, the zipper came open, I was able to zip it down then zip it back up with no issue. So I left the house for the wedding. I made it through the ceremony and cocktail hour, and just before we were going to sit down for dinner, the zipper split again - this time, I couldn't get it to zip down so I could re-zip it!! IT WAS JUST STUCK!! I ended up having to safety pin it as best I could with the safety pins in the bathroom basket, and ended up having to leave the wedding because my whole side was exposed. I loved everything about the dress and would plan to just take it to get a new zipper put in, but now there are little holes from the safety pins and it's rendered totally useless. :(",Love this dress!!

It's tomato red and the big flowers feel cartoonish, almost like Minnie Mouse. But I might try hand-washing from now on. I have not dried any of these in the dryer, but I imagine that would ruin the fabric.For reference, I ordered size large and usually wear a size 12. I am 5'6.5"" and weigh 175. Bust size is 40C.

There's a reason why we left that print behind.  Ugh.  The same dress in the orange and white floral and the leopard print is just great, though.  It's the print, not the dress.

Love the pockets!!,0.0,R2SUUV5SJMGFYX,loveonlineshopping,14.0,"Updateraised from 3 stars to 4 because if I'd liked the drawstring this dress would be all as advertised (though still loses a star because of the weird elastic thing see orig review below). Mine (in black) did not shrink that I could tell with machine wash and dry; I removed it from the dryer while still warm and it isn't wrinkled at all. Quality after laundering seems to be all okay with no seams raveling.Quality seems fine though I haven't laundered it yet. The drawstring doesn't operate properly for 2 reasons: there is a piece of elastic alongside (and attached to) the drawstring in the back plus the fabric of the dress and drawstring has too much friction for the drawstring to slide properly. Even when I did take the time (hassle) to work the gathering enough to match my waist (big butt, small waist) there was no way to get it positioned right in the back because the attached elastic would stretch and prevented the drawstring to slide.I could tell that it wouldn't be flattering on me using the drawstring - as some other reviewers have noted.I decided to remove the drawstring altogether to make more of an A-line shift and found that the drawstring and elastic was tacked at the center back. Ok...carefully removed the stitching that tacked it then found that the elastic portion was (I think) sewed into the side seam on one side. Not willing to open up the side seam so I pulled drawstring and elastic out as far as possible to each side and cut it in the middle. I was able to get both ends of the drawstring completely out but there is still some of the elastic inside the casing in the back.I won't have a final verdict until after laundering so will come back here then.",ok but not grt if you want to remove the drawstring; not good (for me) using the drawstring either!,2023-07-27,4.0,R2Y69T22IUU3CT,Lesley,37.0,"I really wanted to like this dress but couple things- I'm 5'7"", classic pear shape, coming in around 165/170, and I tried the large. If you want to look like a pear in a sack-this is your dress. The top emphasized my smaller shoulders/chest and didn't provide any balance for my booty. The waist is okay but could've cinched tighter. I would've dropped down to a medium but then it would've been super tight. Also the spacing with the buttons was off for me. It kept doing that weird peekaboob thing-not because it was too tight but it just sat weird.The length did nothing for me. It needed to be shorter or longer. And that might be remedied if one wore heels or a taller wedge but I don't have time for that.And I hope you like steaming, ironing, or sleeping next to your dryer because of you don't take this thing out Right away, it's gonna be one big wrinkle. So I wouldn't call it travel friendly.In short- this dress is not a traveling pear's best friend. Gave it three stars because it's made decently for the price point, has pockets, and would be a lovely fit for another shaped person. Where my carrots at? Apples?",Not a great fit for a pear,2023-05-08,3.0

That color is actually close to teal. When I wore it to tea carrying a  lovely hat and a scarf draped over my arm, a doorman told me I looked like a fashion model and I'm not a skinny mini.  I got enough compliments that day that I bought it again in pink, black, and light blue. I also ordered the red color but sent it back due to the waistband being sewn in a crooked angle in front so the buttons made a diagonal line at the waist. However, the other colors were made correctly.I agree about the buttons on some of the dresses. Not only poor quality, but against some colors they stood out too much and took over the dress. I solved that when I ordered better buttons and replaced them. I put lovely black with brass edge heart buttons on the black dress and dark rose heart buttons on the pink dress.  The other dresses were okay with the buttons that came on them although I may change them out too just for fun.  I also tacked down that snap at the bustline so it wouldn't pull. These dresses can go for day or night depending on accessories and overall I'm happy with the purchase.

Same issue when trying to raise my arms and the fit with my arms down, standing relaxed, was not as good as the medium. I really loved the print and wanted this dress to work but the fit is terrible on the top half of the dress (in my opinion).

No, this is not the demnin because I've given up finding what I want.This dress seemed like a reasonable alternative.  Here is the breakdown of pro/con.Pro: Comfortable,  lightweight, has pockets (a BIG plus). It probably can handle a thin short sleeve top if needed (not an item in my wardrobe right now). I have kimono style cover ups that will work just fine.Con: Gaps in underarm (easily fixed). Price is a bit high IMHO.  This next point may just be buyer beware.  My issue is color. I bought the navy blue but am hard pressed to know if it is navy or black.  I had a similar problem with two J.Jill purchases of black and navy slacks. I had to write with permanent marker to be able to distinguish one from the other.  Just had my son weigh in and he said black and had a similar issue with Carhartt once.  Odds are whoever pulled it couldn't tell the difference either.Bottom Line? That's up to you. If they had a denim blue I'd buy again.  It hasn't been washed yet so that is a wait and see.P. S.

So I put them on to work a high school graduation today at about 6am, wore them all day, came home finally, actually wore them as I took a nap, and then - here I am sitting down snacking at my kitchen table and I notice that the front center seam right below the zipper is completely torn through leaving a gaping hole - as though all of the stitching came undone!!  So first, shock - I wore these in front of 750 high school students plus coworkers, PLUS families?!

Call me crazy on colors or I’m just color blind (because my mom thought it was brown but comparison to the picture to real life I can tell) I don’t like it I really wanted all brown.

The rest of the dress was bulky and I had to have it altered to take out 1"" at waist on each side and 2"" at the bottom of the dress on the sides. COLOR: The blue was true to the picture. RUFFLES and TIES: The string was just yarn and had dangling balls. Yarn was white and gold and went ok with dress if I wore gold accessories. The top is covered with small balls that are a bit much but it would be easy to remove the yard and top balls.

For me, I felt it was sized a little on the small side and clung in a very unflattering way on my fupa/ stretched out lower belly from having babies. Even with shape wear, I felt it was still pretty unflattering. I got a beautiful ribbon belt with rhinestones to enhance the dress; that looked great and I highly recommend doing that if you think the dress needs a little dazzle. Lastly, the slit on someone with gorgeous legs would be great, for me- someone who has always had thick thighs and some cellulite- not so much. I was also very afraid if I was to imbibe, get a little tipsy, and not pay attention, the dress could slide sideways and give everyone a view of my downstairs kitty cat and I’m not all about that. I have decided to go with a dress with more of an empire waist/ A-line that is floor length so I can enjoy myself and not worry about a wardrobe malfunction.","A little on the small side, very high slit",2023-04-05,3.0

I wanted something classy but not boring. Slip dresses are classic and it was long enough with enough chest coverage to make the cut.I had some concerns with dresses1. Too tight, I don’t want to look unflattering from any angle because cameras are everywhere.2. Too much chest. I have a larger chest so I wanted to be mindful of that. And the fact that I can’t wear a bra with it, it needed to work with that too.3. Not appropriate for the occasion.This one is perfect. I noticed the colors on her invitation included a purple, but out of fear of matching her bridesmaids I went darker. When it arrived it was VERY light and thin and I got worried it was going to be sheer or too thin. It’s not sheer at all and the fabric is your typical slip dress fabric. My chest area looks great! It covers it enough to make me feel comfortable but it does the opposite of eventuate it. Slip dresses usually fit really tight up top and this one doesn’t. It does, however, sit a little awkward. It’s supposed to drape but it kinda sits up a little more on me but it’s not a big issue. A couple pasties and I’ll be fine but I would say if you don’t have pronounced nips you may not even need those. It’s tight enough to flatter my otherwise boxy shape but loose enough to not make me look sensual. It comes with a ribbon to tie around your waist though if you want to highlight that area more.The color is gorgeous, the length is perfect, fits true to size, it arrived fast, and the price was absolutely unbeatable.",I’m very impressed,2023-09-16,5.0,RF7VCNMHBV8KL,EB,0.0,"On a scale from 1-10, I give it a 5.

But with two of the finest British actors ever, I had to watch this movie. Amazon's teaser describes it as ""wickedly funny and moving,"" but having seen the stage play years ago, I expected it to be more moving than funny, at least for me, and it was.McKellen is such a master at finding a fresh way to portray a character that still feels right, still feels like the character you've seen or read about before, only better, more multi-dimensional, but never overdone. The most diverse actor I can think of, McKellen can play anything from a clock (Beauty and the Beast) to a murderer (DaVinci Code). Here, there's a lot of diversity in one role, Norman. He pampers and cajoles his actor/boss, ""Sir,"" like a nursemaid. He threatens a young woman with violence and blackmail in order to protect Sir. Norman suffers so much pain because he wanted to act, but was never given the chance. He lives through Sir, grabbing a crumb of fulfillment here and there, as by his ability to recite any line in any Shakespearian play when Sir needs reminding. Yet Norman is insecure about making a simple pre-curtain announcement to the audience. In my opinion, Norman rivals Dickens' character Bradley Headstone for pathos, and is ideal for someone of McKellen's talent.Hopkins' Sir is 500% convincing as a man who is self-centered to the point of sociopathy. And now, the sociopath has dementia on top of it all! (And I wasn't just convinced because, sometimes, I looked at Sir's and saw Hannibal Lecter.) You don't like Sir, he infuriates you, yet you still feel sorry for him.The supporting actors are superb. I'd write more about them, but this is too long already.",These two couldn't miss,2018-06-10,5.0,R8SSRJMG5MYUX,Concerned About Movies,7.0,"I made the mistake of ordering the Blu-ray of this movie, but I'll probably return it. After noticing that the picture quality seemed no better than a regular DVD, I checked the disc. Sure enough, no Blu-ray symbol on the disc although the snap-case was clearly labled ""Blu-ray Disc"". Am I the only one this has happened to? Also, there is no menu on my disc and no extras. I tried everything to find a menu and/or a popup menu and/or subtitles and/or anything in addition to the movie, but couldn't ferret out anything. Despite this the back of the case clearly states that the disc contains ""Special Features --- 'From Stage to Screen' and 'Master & Assistant'."" To add insult to injury, the DVD looks suspiciously like a DVD-R, not a commercially produced DVD.As for this TV adaptation of the play ""The Dresser"", I don't think it holds up when compared to the 1983 movie adaptation starring Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. First of all, it seems to me that Ian McKellen was miscast as the dresser and, for the most part, I felt Anthony Hopkins failed to portray his character with the needed imperious yet vulnerable gravitas to make him both compelling and sympathetic. Don't get me wrong, I think both McKellen and Hopkins are both superb actors. But superb actors aren't necessarily superb in all parts. McKellen, especially, seemed to be unsuitable for his role. He does something with his voice that made a great deal of his dialogue unintelligible to this American, and his mincing around seemed to be a caricature of the person he played, rather than part of his identity. But Courtenay, in the 1983 movie adaptation, is spot on and completely believable. Every one of his lines (which are perfectly intelligible, by the way), and each one of his gestures, are impeccably interpreted and absolutely convincing.Ronald Harwood, who wrote the original play, actually was a dresser for the Shakespearean actor Sir Donald Wolfit upon whom Harwood based his play. Sir Wolfit's acting style on stage would undoubtedly be considered histrionic and hammy today, but it was an accepted convention and he was considered one of the finest Shakespearean actors of his time. Unlike Hopkins, Albert Finney captured that dated acting style perfectly when his character performed on stage. Also, unlike Hopkins, Finney's labored breathing and baleful sweating portrayed the actor as being dangerously infirm and on the verge of a heart attack throughout the movie. When Finney's character succumbs at the end of the movie it seems so poignant because we know that a great, but very flawed light has finally been extinguished and those who have been living in his shadow will now have to find their way in darkness. Hopkins, on the other hand, does sweat a lot but seemingly from exertion rather than from bad health, and his death at the end appeared to me to be more of a whimper than a gut-wrenching bang.The 1983 movie version was expanded to include scenes outside of the theater, and the play's dialogue was tightened. It was a ""movie version"" of the play, rather than the ""filmed play"" that we have here. Because it wasn't constrained to just the theater, I found the Finney / Courtenay adaptation to be more visually interesting. And personally, in this new Hopkins / McKellen adaptation I found the spacious dressing room of the star in this aging provincial theater to be improbable and distracting, given what little I know of British theater backstages. It appeared to be more like the set of stage play (which, I think, it was) rather than a real place. But perhaps I'm now swatting at gnats.However, the one really bright spot in this new movie adaptation is toward the end when Edward Fox (who plays Thornton) gives a moving speech to Hopkins. With the weight of forsakened dreams on his shoulders, Fox delivers each line, each word, with an underplayed and restrained emotion that tugs at your heart. Unfortunately, the film's editor kept cutting back to Hopkins during Fox's speech so, I suspect, we could see the effect the speech was having on ""Sir"". But at that point I didn't care, and I almost screamed at my television, ""Keep the dang camera on Fox for heaven's sake!"" For my money Edward Fox, who played a different part in the 1983 movie version, steals the whole show in that all-too-short scene and proves that ""there are no small parts, just small actors."" What a performance!I admit these are the mad ramblings of a non-professional critic. Take them for what they're worth. But my recommendation is that you buy the 1983 movieThe Dresser and skip this version. If you do decide to spend your hard earned money on this version, don't buy the Blu-ray",This Adaptation Was Okay But Uninspired.,2016-08-03,3.0

All the others were true to the images on this page. However, as is the case with many Amazon-made (/sold) items, the quality of the material was sub-par.My only real issue with this dress is that of those 5 I ordered, three of them had necklines that looked stretched out, as though there was just too much material there (not as though they'd been worn before). One was so bad that I even thought about gathering the extra material at the very front of the neckline and sewing it to make an impromptu v-neck but didn't think that would look good since that part of the dress is so thin. It was frustrating - I thought I'd found a dress I really liked - good length, loved the pockets - but the neckline, which is impossible to hide or really adjust, just looked frumpy.

I have size 32/34J. It actually made my bust look a lot smaller in it than in most outfits. But you could wear with small bust too bc fabric is flowing....it is just really forgiving of both I think.Cons1) I wish there was a flap behind the buttons because when I sat down the dress wasn't even tight on me but my muffin top tummy (post several babies) and thighs spread and the slight pressure on the buttons gaped, basically you can see inside dress2) it looked kind of like a nightshirt on me. I don't know if it was the navy color? My husband said it was like the color was trying to be dressy but the style of dress was very casual.3) not sure why but my arms felt itchy after trying it on?

The fabric is nice and silky. I'm 5' 2"", have a short waist, a large chest (40dd) and larger arms. Though the XL fit me and the arms weren't too tight, the wrap section around the boobs was odd and left a huge gap.  It worked ""ok"" if I didn't hook the loop to keep it closed, but it was way too revealing for the occasion.  The length was almost Tea length on me, just to the knee. The belt was also odd, it was sewn in on the side and was so long that it wrapped around a couple times. The tie was either super short or way too long. I wish the belt was removable. Overall the dress made me look frumpy. I wish there were more hook/loop options in the chest area or that you could adjust the wrap itself.

Around the neckline of the dress is a wire fashioned in a v-shape to hold the structure of the neckline, but it feels very cheap. The material is thin and it feels like someone just slipped a piece of wire in there.If you have a slender body or nice figure this may look good on you. The dress is ruched but it's a bodycon dress, so it won't do anything to change your silhouette. I didn't find it to be particularly flattering, comfortable or well made.

One of the dresses - the animal print - came with one strap stitched backwards so I had to rip the strap out, turn it around and restitch. The straps on another one frayed after one wearing even before washing (I was able to trim the loose threads and it looks fine, but you definitely get what you pay for 😊). Ultimately I recommend this dress because it’s cool in my hot climate (New Orleans) and for the money it looks classy and I get a ton of compliments. Fit: I’m 5’5”,132 lbs, 34C - ordered a size M which fit fine (though, as discussed, inconsistent). I’ll be cutting off at least one of the dresses and hemming to just above the knee for a dressier night look. These guys will probably only last a season but for the price they’ve made my summer so easy - for less than $200 you can throw on a different one every other day and your hot-weather wardrobe is pretty much complete.

The problem is I tried two of the colors and they look nothing like the pictures. First I tried Green, which is shown as being a light minty aqua color, but what I was sent looked more gray than green. Then I tried Lake, which was supposed to be a light warm minty green. What I was sent was a cool deep teal. I noticed in other reviews and pictures that this seems to be a problem with other colors as well. Neither of the colors I was sent suited me, so unfortunately I’ll have to forget about owning this dress. If having the exact color in the picture is important to you, you may be disappointed.

I do wish the straps were a little wider. They look a little off balanced to me, like someone stuck straps on a strapless dress last minute. Plus I like straps that hide my bra strap better. I wish the model in the photos didn’t have her hair over the straps.I am 5’9 and currently a little over 200lbs and an XL fit even though the measurements said it wouldn’t.I like it enough that I’m going to look at other dresses by this brand in case there’s something similar but not exact.Update: I got a solid color first time and it was soft and kind of knit feeling and quite stretchy. I got a print the second time and it is noticing y tightest even though it’s the same size. The fabric is a bit more glossy and “polyester” feeling. (It’s 35% poly.) I guess on the plus side, I just learned that coffee wipes off the print fabric pretty easily (it’s dark print so it barely left a mark).

They are exceptionally cheap - to the point it cheapens the entire dress.2) This dress is huge. While I run between an XS-S, when I pulled this out of the bag, I was convinced they sent me the wrong size. What saves that, however, is the weight of the material in the skirt. It weighs the excess fabric down in the waist so it touches the skin (for the most part).I will keep the dress because I need something for a party in two days and lack time to get something else, but I wouldn't wear this to anything beyond a VERY casual event (like a kids birthday party).All this said, it's still a cute dress, and if the sizes were more true, I might be able to overlook the hardware issue.",Good for one summer,2023-07-13,3.0

However, the 'single shoulder' wouldn't stay in place once I put it on. The wrap continued to slip off of my shoulder, roll up, and dig into my neck. When I snugged it down over my shoulder, it snugged to my chest like a corset and wouldn't allow me to move my arm. Whatsmore, the seam that was supposed to be in the middle of the sleeve fell behind my shoulder blade, creating a bizarre ruching texture.I love the fit of this dress, but would love to see some adjustability in the single shoulder going forward.

It fit as expected... Still a little small as in the best position placed on me, my nipple was not in the designated part of the bra. It held on and clasped together very well, but my breasts are not perky, they hang heavy in the bottome-kinda bell shaped-and did not find this helpful for lift at all, and bottom and inside corner edges would peel away a bit. Also no matter how I positioned the sticky cups, my cleavage created was unflattering as my boobs kind of folded over themselves and the act of pulling them together gave me the sports bra uniboob effect, rather than helping with my hourglass shape, and felt it looked werid in my clothes.This is however the best sticky bra I've tried, as it actually fit the best, and the adhesive is pretty good quality even after a rinse (as well as constantly peeling off and attempting to readjust, and it covers nipping. However, in tight white (a.k.a. see through in the chest for me) clothing it was very obvious I was wearing something on my breasts, and in some other clothing the front clasps showed as weird little bumps, however that probably had something to do with the imperfect fit.If you are just looking for cleavage and fit well into conventional/mass produced bra sizes this is a good product.If you are hoping for any sort of lift so you can finally wear those cute halters and backless pieces of clothing without a band or straps, but are a gal with large, heavy breasts and a small ribcage - this is not the product for you.Writing a detailed review with my normal bra size as well as the size I ordered because reviews like this help me make the best informed decision to buy or to keep looking.

The front section that ties is perfect for covering up a bit of belly that I don’t like showing off. The dress is shorter than I expected - definitely wearing some slip shorts underneath and/or being careful about bending over.The fabric is very silky feeling.

My experience with these shoes was quite a journey, and I'm excited to share my insights with you.Firstly, the aesthetics of these shoes are undeniably appealing. They embody a clean and sleek style that can effortlessly transition from a casual day out to a business meeting. The navy color adds a touch of sophistication that elevates any outfit.The comfort level of these shoes is commendable. They offer the snug fit of a sneaker while maintaining the professional look of a dress shoe. However, I would recommend swapping out the original laces for smoother ones to enhance the overall comfort.The craftsmanship of these shoes is noteworthy. The design, the stitching, and the overall build quality reflect a high level of attention to detail. Moreover, the price point is quite attractive, making these shoes a great value for money.However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are a few areas where these shoes could use some improvement.Pros:+ Stylish and versatile design: These shoes can easily transition between casual and professional settings.+ Comfort: They offer a level of comfort comparable to much more expensive shoes.+ Craftsmanship: The attention to detail and build quality are impressive.+ Price: They offer great value for money.Cons:- Color inconsistency: The grey color variant seems to resemble the blue one, which can be misleading.- Cushioning and arch support: The shoes could use more cushioning and better arch support. An insert might be necessary for extended wear.- Durability: Some users have reported issues with the upper part separating from the sole after a few months of use.- Heat retention: These shoes tend to retain heat, which might lead to sweaty feet after a few hours of wear.In conclusion, the Bruno Marc Men's Oxfords Sneakers Casual Dress Shoes are a stylish and affordable option for those seeking a versatile pair of shoes. However, potential buyers should be aware of the issues regarding comfort and durability. Despite these drawbacks, I believe these shoes offer good value for their price and can be a great addition to any wardrobe.",Navigating the Versatility of Bruno Marc Men's Oxfords Sneakers,2023-07-28,4.0,R2HVYVJB3OADQA,Kevin Sutcliffe,0.0,These shoes look great and I was disappointed to return them.

Otherwise, perfect shoe.",0.0,REOG2C5OES36C,Amazon Customer,24.0,"Before I purchased this shoe on Amazon, I had been trying on different brands and styles of shoes at various stores. I knew I wanted something built with good materials that would last me several years, look good with a variety of different clothing options, and work well for a wide variety of activities including hiking, working out, walking around all day, etc., and also at a good price. I'm not a fan of spending tons of money on several different pairs of shoes tailored to each individual activity. I found a pair of these at a store and really liked how they looked and fit. My foot fits well in the size I purchased, and there is some arch support as well, but not overpowering. I've never has a pair of Merrell's before, but they're known for good quality and these shoes look and feel like good quality. They have real leather, thick tractiony soles, an agressive look, and tons of color options. I've worn them for a couple of weeks and they feel great. The best part was the price. At the store I tried them on at, they cost $120. Then I checked on Amazon and they had my size for under $60. I noticed the price was different depending on size, and possibly color, with some of them costing as much as $120. I'm not sure why this is. You might want to select different options before purchasing to see if one size or color is a better price. They are also probably a bit heavy for people that want something really light for running or working out, but for me it just makes my workout a little more challenging. It's not supposed to be easy, right? Other than that, there were a couple of other little issues I should mention. For some reason, the shoe I got looked like a lighter shade than what was pictured. Then I held the shoe up next to the picture, and they looked the same color. It may be that the pictures were taken under different lighting conditions that made them seem a bit darker, I don't know, but I've seen other reviews that say the color is different, and I thought so too until I held them right next to each other. A trick of the mind. The last issue is size, and this is the most important. I'm glad I tried them on at a store first, because I generally wear a 10-1/2, sometimes an 11. At the store I needed an 11-1/2, but they fit perfectly! I ordered an 11-1/2, and again they fit perfectly. So I would probably order one size large if you want them to fit. On a last note, I liked these so much that I ordered another pair of a different color. I felt like these were such a great shoe at such a great price, it was well worth it to have a second pair. These will probably last me a good 10 years between the two.",Great Shoe!,2023-07-27,5.0,R27PC563N1DLR1,Wind,0.0,"The shoes were a great price, fit well, but appear to be factory seconds.

So I got these, and they are fine for what they cost. They are not perfect and I would recommend not using them under the same conditions I have, which is to say walk 5 miles a day in dusty, rocky terrain to and from work and stand for five hours in a greasy kitchen. I managed to get a quarter sized hole within 3 months. So I bought another pair.Hey, if you can find better under worse conditions, by all means go for those, but if I need shoes now for a little cheap, I'm not going to mind going for what I know. What I will say is that they are not terribly comfortable after a while, to the point I had to get some Dr. Scholls soles to make them more bearable. The default soles are glued in, so if you are going to change them out, you should know about that.These are okay if you need something and don't want to experiment, but I also notice the usual price is like $50, which I don't know if I can recommend under such conditions, but these seem to stay on sale at $30, so that's a price I recommend. In short, they're fine but they will need to be replaced if under enough pressure. They're good if you need something on a budget in a short time.",Buy for $30 or less,2023-06-29,3.0

I have a very high instep so a lot of shoes that are low in the middle won’t fit me correctly or they’ll rub blisters etc. After reading many reviews I’ve noticed that people that are wearing a 8 1/2 or larger are the majority of the people having issues with these shoes, so never buy shoes made in china without measuring your foot as they suggest. I know this firsthand because all my friends tell me I have cute shoes, but my shoe are at least three sizes smaller than theirs, and when they tried to buy the same style of shoe, it doesn’t fit a large foot. so with that being said, measure your foot before purchasing these shoes because they are cut to fit people with smaller feet.I personally love the shoes I think they’re really comfortable however, I’m usually wearing them out to eat or to run a quick errand.

The shoe is very comfortable and very lightweight. The shoe size fit as expected. But the reason I gave it low stars is because within 2 weeks the bottom of the shoe sole wore off really quickly.

I do tend to throw my slippers into the wash every so often so I thought this might be better. There is a trade off, however, compared to regular slippers. The insole is actually a bit thin and the slipper itself does not provide additional cushioning for the foot. So in comparison, the thickness of the slipper bottom is noticeable less compared to the regular ones. A few months in and you can feel the floor hardness. Additionally, I do see that the sewing and support are wearing out faster than any other ones I've had.

I don't wear them often & that's mostly because they're only comfortable for only a few hours and then the front part of the shoes starts pushing on my toes as well as the sides and so after a while it just gets too painful to have them on any longer.At first when I was only wearing them for a walk, I felt like these are probably one of the most comfortable sneakers that I've ever worn as I know Sketchers make comfortable shoes & I have a few of them and my wife swears by them but once I had these on for a full day, I couldn't wait to take them off.  First I thought perhaps it's because I tied them too tight but then I just left them untied/loose and still had same tightness issues with the difference that the shoes was now coming off since it was way too loose .. and it's not that my feet are wide .. I am size 9 but I usually wear size 9.5 just to give my feet some breathing room but with these shoes, I felt maybe I needed the wider size.  With that said, there are still some good things to say about the shoes like for example, the memory foam is just right .. not very foamy that it feels squishy & not so little that you feel every step.  Another good thing about them is the shoe laces stay put and won't come undone as like some of my other shoes.  Another big plus is that they're lightweight with breathable; the mesh material keep your feet from heating up.As for the negatives, aside from the stiffness in the toe area, there is also no arch support & yet another reason for not recommending these for an all day use.  Looks wise, they're ok but there are much better looking sneakers out there but then again Skechers are not famous for their looks .. interestingly, the sneakers look wide but aren't, so I wonder how the wider ones actually may look like .. probably not too flattering.  The outer mesh is not water-proof or water resistant .. if it rains or you step into a small puddle of water, your feet will get wet .. some mesh shoes come with water resistant qualities but if you're looking for that here, forget it.  Last but not the least, the bottom/soles are way too soft so most probably they would wear out fast .. but then that's the price of cushy sneaker.All in all, they're decent sneakers if you only wear them for a few hours once in a while but for anything longer (like a day at the office) or if you have a flat foot, I would look elsewhere.",Good for a few hours but not an all day shoe!,2023-02-18,3.0

That's what we all say to ourselves at the start of the new year. With promises to improve our static routine, only for our dreams to diminish far before the first few weeks.One day I woke up from my monotonous 9-5 office job routine and noticed I had gained nearly 30lbs. I was now overweight. I hated who I saw in the mirror. I looked at my bank account and saw hundreds of dollars spent on food delivery. Then something just snapped, something inside of me. I didn’t care anymore. I didn’t care about being better at Microsoft Excel. I didn’t care to spend any more money on food that cost nearly an hour’s worth of my time. All I cared about was getting back into shape.So I began walking. Walking every day for 30-45 minutes on an incline, while also strictly adhering to a calorie deficit. After weeks of hard work I started to see results. I had lost nearly 15lbs. I felt lighter, and had more energy. I even felt more confident in myself. But I still felt like something was missing.I had noticed that my pair of New Balance 574’s, that I’ve owned since 2021, had already worn down to the midsole. It was affecting the way I walk, causing lower back and knee pain after my workout routine. With all the money I saved from not using food delivery services the past few months, I decided to treat myself to a new pair of walking shoes.THE ACTUAL REVIEW (START HERE, DON’T EVEN READ THE FIRST PART TBH):I have been a fan of New Balance for a long time. The 574, 990, 992: all of these shoes have such iconic silhouettes that are stylish and comfortable. However, I don’t consider these shoes fit for running. Don’t get me wrong, I am NOT a runner, I shouldn’t even have a say in whether a shoe is good for you or not. But I feel like these shoes are bulky, and designed with the intention of being worn for short periods of time. More like a sneaker, per say. As mentioned previously, I had been walking in my 574’s for a long time now, so I decided to try a different style shoe and stumbled across the New Balance 520 V7.FIRST IMPRESSIONS:This shoe was incredibly inexpensive. I bought a slightly used pair from Amazon for less than $33. It had a few mystery hairs on it but I just lint rolled them off and sprayed it with a little disinfectant. Not like it was worn for an extensive amount of time by the previous owner. Also the box looked like someone punched it (perhaps a metaphor of my overindulging, frustrated self from the past). Other than that, the shoe was in perfect condition, with the tags still on it.SIZE AND FIT:A lot of these reviews say to size up. Here’s what I have to say. On paper, my foot size should fit a size 8 shoe. However nobody’s foot size is a one-sized-fits-all situation. I cringe at the phrase “true to size” because I feel like for my whole early adult life I’ve struggled with finding my right shoe size. I also have a WIDE FOOT (4”), so I opted for the wide sizing. A size that always seems to work for me now without fail is 8.5. My foot is just under 26cm long, and as you can see from the insole measurement in my photos, the insole runs around 26.5cm. I find that the 8.5 WIDE fits me perfectly, with about a thumbs length to spare at the toe box. Your foot swells when you walk, so your running shoes are typically slightly larger than your regular fashionable shoes. I really hope this information helps because it’s always a gamble when ordering shoes online.STYLE:Honestly, this shoe is not gonna turn heads. When I see this shoe I think of a general manager on casual Fridays. I think of a golfer who just changed out of their shoes to go eat at Applebee’s after hitting the course. I got the white colorway because you can make a gym outfit with your eyes closed (matches everything). I would personally never wear these out in public, (aside from the gym) but that’s just me.COMFORT:Aside from having a wide foot, I also have flat feet. Pick your battles, am I right? I have the worst of both worlds. This shoe offers okay arch support, but it made my feet sore after first use. After doing around 5 miles of walking in these shoes, I can now say that they are very comfortable on my feet. I mainly walk on a treadmill so I haven’t really gotten any feedback on the tread pattern, but judging by its design, it’s really only meant for hard flat surfaces. It also has a sort of bump at the ball of your foot that compresses downward after a couple wears. The shape of the outsole is nice because it is rounded at the heel, and the foam on the outsole is really soft. They would be really comfortable to wear all day since they’re light and breathable as well.CONCLUSION:This shoe is definitely worth it for the price. If you’re a walker I would pick these up again in a heartbeat. Sizing was perfect for me, maybe order two pairs if you’re between sizes and return one. Also remember your feet swell if you intend to use these for cardio, a slightly larger fit can be beneficial. They’re not the flashiest shoes, but they are extremely practical for their purpose: and you cannot beat the comfort at this price point. Time will tell how long these will last, but in this moment, I am a satisfied customer.Go out there and chase your dreams!

What's even more impressive is that there was absolutely no break-in period required. I wore them straight out of the box, and my feet were great from the get-go.One of the standout features for me is how incredibly lightweight they are. It feels like I'm hardly wearing shoes at all. This makes them perfect not only for running but also for everyday wear. Whether I'm hitting the pavement or just going about my daily activities, these shoes provide the support and comfort I need.Another huge plus is how breezy and cool they keep my feet, even during warm weather. The ventilation in these shoes is top-notch, and it really helps in preventing that uncomfortable sweaty feeling. My feet stay cool and fresh throughout the day.And let's not forget about style. These shoes are not only functional but also incredibly stylish. I've received compliments on their sleek design, and they easily pair with both athletic wear and casual outfits. They're versatile enough to suit any occasion.In conclusion, the New Balance Men's Fresh Foam Roav V1 Running Shoes are a winner in my book.

I bought them with the intent to go hiking around since my hiking shoes were getting worn out and I wanted to try out something lighter weight. After they arrived, I spent about a week breaking them in before going out on any hikes. Even after a week of break-in, the outsoles were still surprisingly stiff but I did like the lightness and breathability of the shoe.I take these out on a first easy hike (<1.5mi and less than 100ft elevation gain) and was not impressed at all. The grip is not good on even dry, flat rock. They seem okay on a soft path, but as soon as I encountered any wetness, the grip is poor. Wet rocks are dangerous with these shoes and I nearly fell a few times on that first easy hike just walking around.I'm not sure what Saucony means by ""Trail Running Shoe"", but I don't think they are suitable even as a ""trail walking shoe"". I wouldn't use these for anything that isn't on a paved path.I have since decided that these shoes are not to ever be used for hiking again and have relegated them to daily wear (office job) and the gym. They are okay for that purpose. After a month, the insoles and midsoles are still too stiff and do not offer much arc support. Standing around in these shoes gets my feet aching in 30 minutes or less. They are decent for the gym since they are lightweight and breathable.Overall, I would not recommend these shoes for any purpose. There are much better options out there.","Good looks, lightweight, and breathable, but many downsides",2023-07-17,3.0

I thought it would be perfect- soft, flexible, and breathable- once I swapped out the insoles. However what I received was a stiff, cheap feeling, typical synthetic material shoe. The 'knit' is just a mesh pattern on the outside that does nothing for airflow.On top of all that it runs tight with a narrow toebox. Removing the insoles gave me adequate room but the shoe just feels awful. Not at all worth the normal $55+ asking price.  The color is nice but that's the only thing good about these.

Buying really expensive footwear, paying for custom insoles, knee braces, ankle braces, compression sleeves...all of it. I bought these shoes after doing some research and from the 1st day I wore them, everything changed. I can be on my feet for 10+ hours no with little to NO pain and I am not fatigued like I usually am after a long day at work. I would have never guessed it, but this blade design is genius. I dont think Ill ever own a different type of shoe. Now if you're dealing with rain or need to protect your toes then you should dress accordingly, but even with that small sacrifice Id say these shoes are worth every penny and more! Im buying more in different colors, I cant believe it.","Best $45 you will ever spend, period.",2023-10-01,5.0,R1SJEAPFBUKIQE,Genji Ooka,13.0,"I've been wearing issues for about 4 days now, wearing outside inside wherever I may go. They are comfortable, they feel different than normal shoes, the only thing I would say that I had an issue with these shoes, would be the hard material on the outside, it gets scratched very easily as you can see in the third picture.Now, This is on the inside like where both the feet would meet together. They've rubbed together quite often, I guess with the way that I walk. As you can see it does leave a scuff mark on the inside of the shoe. In the second picture, is the outside of the show which has very little to no scuff mark on them. So I have to come to the assumption that is from the shoes sliding together as I walk.Another thing about the shoes, I would probably say I'd change out the soul with another ones I have found on here on Amazon that I've come to like and put in almost all my shoes. Issues are usable for driving as well, I was low concerned about that with the fact that has a gap in the center of the bottom of the shoe, but I had very little issues with this. Just sitting in the driver seat a little bit and seeing how it felt against the pedals allowed me to accommodate my driving style if I needed to.The only thing I've not done avidly with these shoes would be running I'd say. So I can't see much for its durability test in running, but I have done a couple of quick jogs to get from point A to point B real quick. But overall, was putting in over 10,000 steps each day for the last 4 days, these shoes are very nice and do you keep my feet comfortable. The cloth material isn't interesting choice on the shoes and does allow for breathability within the shoes. I did get these shoes in a size 9.5, as as my shoe size, and they fit perfectly around my feet. So I'd say definitely get the size that you most comfortably wear avidly.",These are not bad for the price,2023-02-04,3.0

This is the third time I have bought these shoes. I use them to go to work and they work great for me because I don't like waring high heels, they are very comfortable and they look good for a work environment. I keep buying these shoes because I have never had any problems with them in terms of being too big, or too small or making my feet hurt or bleed in some place. I just want something I know will work from the moment I put my foot in them until I have to throw them out without the anxiety of having 500 band aids handy in case they hurt me. They last me about a year/ year and half of daily use for work at an office and 2 hours of walking to and from work, so I keep buying them on repeat because they work great for my purposes. The first time I bought these shoes I bought them directly from Clarks in the store after trying them on and hoping that they would work. The other two times I bought them from amazon and they seemed identical. However, this last time I bought them these shoes via amazon, the fit is a little larger than the other two previous times, even when compared to the fit at the end of their life when they had holes in the soles. Somewhat unfortunate, but I still like them and I will keep buying them over and over, although I may drop half a size next time, I don't know.

Tried a few full half marathon runs on them but they're probably not suited for 8+ mile runs, could use more cushioning and support for that.  Not sure why the same size was around a full smaller than their 880v12 so that's something to watch out for, but the extra wide is still properly extra wide.

Not only do they make every shoe fit better, but they don't exert the same force on the lace holes as traditional laces, so you shouldn't have a problem with the strap breaking.Couple things:1. The shoe I ordered was not the same as pictured. The picture has black/charcoal, plus  hot red/coral stripes. The one I received had black stripes but with the hot red lace holes/straps. Not a bad looking shoe, but not what I was looking for.2. I have this same exact shoe but in true red with black stripes that I bought back in 2020. They've been awesome shoes that I've worn sparingly because I like them so much I want to keep them for awhile, and I doubt they bring those back. They're super comfortable for casual wear and lots of standing or walking. I'm athletic build - 5'9"" @ 172 lbs, and the cushion is great. I don't run in these or workout, they're fine for a quick sprint or two, but I wouldn't buy these for running, they're not meant for that.On that note about my old pair - this shoe I just received is...different. So much so that I wasn't sure if it was authentic. I think it is now after looking around, but I'm still only like 85% sure.The foam insert for the insole says Cloudfoam on it, but my 2020's don't. OK fine, model upgrade, right? Yeah....but the one's on Adidas's current website don't say Cloudfoam, they just say ADIDAS - same as my '20 red ones. But they do say ""Cloudfoam comfort"" on the product description on the website. So it could be an older photo? OK...but they don't list this color combination (all black/charcoal with hot red lace loops) as an option. Also, this color option is very hard to find outside of Amazon. I checked Academy Sports, Famous Footwear, DICK's, and a handful of other reputable sites, and the only other place I found them was eBay. Not exactly a strong case for authenticity. So I'm really not sure what to think, but I'm not a professional shoe detective either...Those things wouldn't matter except for these shoes just aren't as comfortable as my 2020's. The foam insert isn't as comfortable, and I just vividly remember the ""aahhhh"" pillow comfort feeling of my 2020's when I slipped them on in the store. These were much more firm as far as my memory can tell.So I returned them. They're still fine if you love the color combo.",Not sure what to think,2023-04-05,3.0

Navigating the vast landscape of men’s footwear, I decided to try out the Bruno Marc Men’s Square Toe Classic Business Dress Shoes. After a couple of weeks of wear, spanning various occasions and durations, my feelings on these shoes are quite mixed.An Experience of Ups and Downs: The realm of dress shoes is akin to a vast ocean, where some choices are truly stellar, some are complete misses, and then there are those that sail right in between. The Bruno Marc shoes belong to this middle category. Let me delineate my observations:Pros:👞 Stylish Design: Stepping out with these, one cannot help but appreciate the classic allure of the square-toe design. It effortlessly marries a sense of old-world charm with contemporary elegance, making it apt for both high-stakes business meetings and those relaxing evening dinners with close friends.🌬️ Breathable Lining: This feature genuinely shines, especially on those longer days. The breathable leather lining promises and delivers on its sweat-absorbent nature, ensuring that even after hours, my feet felt relatively refreshed and devoid of the usual stuffiness some shoes bring.🛏️ Comfortable Insole: Taking a deeper dive into comfort, the soft leather-covered latex insole serves its purpose. It might not feel like you’re walking on a feathered bed, but for everyday wear, it strikes a decent balance between cushioning and support, aiding in those prolonged hours of wear.Cons:🎨 Material Quality: Upon closer inspection, the man-made material seems to betray the shoe’s aesthetic appeal. While it maintains a polished look from afar, up close it misses that premium, authentic touch one often expects from more high-end business dress shoes.🔗 Lace-Up Closure: Navigating through my daily routine, the lace-up mechanism, though functional, fell a tad short of expectations. It lacked that firm grip, leading me to stop and readjust the laces a couple of times, which was slightly inconvenient amidst a hectic day.⏳ Longevity Concerns: Reflecting on the material and overall build, I harbor certain reservations regarding the shoe’s durability, especially under the rigors of daily wear. The test of time will truly reveal its mettle.Striding the Middle Path: Embracing both its strengths and weaknesses, the Bruno Marc Men’s Square Toe Classic Business Dress Shoes cater to specific footwear needs without truly excelling. For occasional wear or when on a tighter budget, they might just fit the bill. While they won’t replace my favorite pair anytime soon, they certainly find a place in my rotation for certain events and settings. As you ponder on this potential addition to your collection, weigh the pros and cons, and decide based on what resonates with your personal and professional requirements.🚶‍♂️🤔👟.",A Middle-of-the-Road Footwear Experience,2023-09-29,3.0

But so far, they are very comfortable! I don’t have super wide feet from sole to heel, but I’ve been wanting a little more space in the toe box area for my bunions and wiggle room for my toes (apparently that’s part of why I have bunions. Who’da thunk). These fit great for what I was wanting!It blows my mind how many people gave these a low rating because of how wide they are. THAT’S LITERALLY THE WHOLE ENTIRE POINT. If you aren’t intentionally shopping for “wide toe box” shoes for a good healthy toe splay (google it), then these probably wouldn’t be a good fit for you! 🙂I personally like the look of the wider, rounded toe. I’m 6’ and have larger feet than the average woman (thanks mom), so I always think sneakers with a narrow toe makes my feet look long and funny. iiii think the width makes them look more proportional to my body and not “clown like” at all. But that’s just my opinion!I would say the canvas color is a true, clean, bright white. The laces and patch on the heel are a bit more cream…which I love!I docked one star for the outer toe area being caved in on both shoes. It was hard to capture in a picture, but they are just smashed in. I’m sure it was an issue with how tightly they were packaged together, and they’ll hopefully loosen up to their original shape with time and wear. I might stuff something in them to speed up the re-shaping process a little. It’s not a huge deal, nor is it a deal breaker…I just think a brand new pair of shoes should arrive good to go and ready to wear! 🙂All that being said, I would probably purchase them again. Even if they only last me a little while, you get what you pay for and the price was right for me! Hope this helps someone.","They’re INTENTIONALLY wide, people.",2023-10-04,4.0,RYM099A9RHJ38,Michael T Hall,0.0,"I bought a pair of these based on the foot length guide and they crushed the top of my feet.

I started running in Altras and the found their quality to decrease as the price increased. I went to Topo Athletic and just always looking for good shoes for a good priceOk the reviewAt ~$50 these shoes after 6.5 miles are so good. They feel comfortable without feeling like I’m going to topple over (hokas). The only  thing I would “change” I guess is adding a last eye hole to tie them runners style. Also as I first went to tighten the laces I had to pull really hard to move the laces through the two middle loops. It even seemed that the laces were glued to the plastic. The only thing I can’t say is how many miles they will last.I can say I am excited to try out the trail shoes!!,Bang for your Buck,2023-09-26,4.0,RIBUVNVH5PDB1,Blaise,0.0,"I've used these for walking & hiking, and they felt decent for that. But for running I'm going to be looking elsewhere.They have really thick soles so you can't feel the ground very well, and if you can't feel it your feet come down harder on the ground which is harder on your feet... But while they have thick soles, they are not soft at all. So in my opinion it's the worst of both worlds if you were going to combine a barefoot style shoe and a traditional running shoe.It might be what you're looking for, but it's definitely not what I was hoping for.","Good for walking, I personally think they're bad for running.",2023-09-21,3.0

If you're looking for a reliable, space-saving, and adjustable weight bench for a full-body workout, I highly recommend the bench - it's an investment you won't regret!",Ultimate Full Body Workout Companion!,2023-07-31,5.0,R2AK2BQ5WIQN1L,Monsternsyd,380.0,"Bought hoping that it would fill the role of incline, decline, and flat bench. Works descent as flat bench or incline. Decline is VERY uncomfortable.  Add in the fact that the fabric on the lower seat tore the very first time it was used and I can't recommend this bench for purchase.  The best thing about this bench is it folds up nicely. So if you want something cheap that stores easily and will break pretty quick then buy this product.**Updated** two weeks in -OK- so full disclosure here... I don't like this bench, almost to the point of hatred. It all started with the tear on day one.I tried to like it. I really did.I've used it daily for a variety of exercises and really attempted to get to know it and find a bond.Really though, the more time I spend with it the less I like it.At first glance it seems to be nice which is why I had difficulty understanding why I didn't like it.Thus I really started looking at all the features and trying to analyze what exactly it was that bothered me so much and why everyone else seems to like it.I'm writing this more lengthy review so that if you do decide to purchase this bench you know better what your getting.Customer service seems good as they contacted me after my last review and offered me a $40 discount and a replacement seat to repair the tear. The representative did ask that I give a four or five star review. Unfortunately I can't in good conscience do that.  In appreciation of their effort to make it right I will give another star.There are some good things but personally I feel the bad outweigh them.The good stuff:*The stitches are nice and straight.*The finish looks nice out of the box. *It arrives assembled.*It easily folds up to set aside or pack away.The Bad stuff: *The bench is expensive. Currently it sells for $159.99. You can get a really good flat bench for that. -While this bench has multiple angles, it's NOT REALLY GOOD at any of them. -I'd say this bench is worth $75 max. Its currently priced at twice that. *The bench is overly high...even for a tall person. I'm 6'1"". From my heel to the back of my knee is 20"". -The bench when flat measures 21"" from the floor. The average heel to back of knee varies from 17.4""-23.7"". -If your not tall your feet will be off the floor or you'll be on your toes.*The higher center of gravity causes wobble from side to side. (Flybird if your paying attention please lower the bench or widen the feet.) -Its least noticeable in the most uncomfortable mode- decline. As you increase the angle, or the weight, the wobble is more noticeable.**DANGER** - This is very apparent if you try an incline with any substantial weight.*The finish of the fabric wears very quickly. The lower pad tore the first day. -There are pinch points in the fabric of the seat from hanging by my knees in the decline position. -There are small rub marks in the fabric where the surface is already rubbing off with 2 weeks of usage.*The decline position is AGRESSIVE. Its a 30degree angle.  -The foot pad is twenty inches from the seat in the shortest position. Even I am hanging by the back of my knees and my toes. Most people won't be able to. -The footpad only has two height adjustment holes. There need to be more holes higher up to accommodate regular sized humans. -If your not overly tall the decline function will be completely unusable unless you don't use the foot pads and only hang by the back of your knees.  -The very next backboard hole for decline takes you to 5degrees. You may as well be flat at that point. -The seat angle and back pad angle don't match up in full decline. -The back pad has a hump in it. This causes you to hyperextend your spine when you have the bench in full decline.*The angle retaining pin can be set but not lock in place. -It only slides into the hole about 1/4"". You can overlook this very easily. -There needs to be a better way to lock the bench in place but theres not. A safety pin, screw, or anything really.**DANGER** - This will be very apparent the first time to go to lie back and the bench slams down into full decline. Hopefully you don't have a bunch of weight over your head when it happens.I'm including more pictures to show everything mentioned above.Additionally I'm including an example image to show the decline angle variables on paper compared to a Marcy slant board.The Marcy slant board you see in the background under to Flybird bench displays the excessive angle of this bench.Ultimately, after two weeks of usage and intense scrutiny I still stand by my previous statement - I don't recommend this bench for purchase.Unless your REALLY tall and only plan on doing body weight exercises or very light dumbbell work I'd even say ITS PROBABLY DANGEROUS!!!Personally this is one of the few pieces of gym equipment that I fully regret purchasing.Honestly I really want to send it back. Its to the point where just looking at it kind of makes me angry.Save your money. Buy something better.My opinion is that this is a shoddily produced bench made for skinny giants that aren't planning on doing any heavy lifting while using it.It folds up nice though. I guess there is that.","Dangerous, unfit for heavy lifting, and poorly made",2021-04-19,3.0

I ordered his normal size, 10.5 based on the information saying ""Fits normally"". The green ones fit perfectly but the grey boat shoe loafer was 1/2 a size larger and seemed like it was a ""wide"" fit. This created flipping up and down with the heel when he walked. While this may not bother some people it wasn't working for my husband even with socks he felt he was slipping out of them. We bought these as an alternative to Hey Dude's after my husband decided he liked the design but wasn't sure how he'd feel about the shoes and we didn't want to pay their price for something he may not even wear enough. He has issues with his arches and his feet get sore if he's on them too long. He was pleasantly surprised with the comfort of the shoe for the price point. Sadly we are in the process of exchanging the boat-style shoe for 1/2 a size smaller so these fit properly. Completing an exchange through Amazon has proven to be a challenge when it's came to shoes especially if an added sale or deal was applied during purchase. (They will try not to honor the added sale) since it's through a third-party seller. This means you need to do a return and re-order the shoe completely. With that said my suggestion is if you have any doubt on sizing or questioning sizing I'd say the boat style runs a little wider and is a little bigger while the standard loafer is true to size. I'd personally order a pair in both sizes and just do a return verse trying to get an even exchange or reach out to the seller first instead of trying to go through Amazon customer support. We just wanted an exchange for 1/2 a size smaller since my husband really likes the light grey color and style of these shoes. From what we are seeing so far they are just as good as Hey Dude's and I believe they'd hold up about the same length of time. I don't see them lasting long if they get wet frequently but with normal wear, they should last a while. We already ordered an additional pair of loafers in blue so he has different colors. My husband loves them which is saying something since normally he lives in sneakers and occasionally flip-flops. Don't hesitate if you want a lightweight, casual, comfortable spring-to-fall shoe. My husband stated that he never thought he could comfortably wear shoes without socks, until now.","Boat shoes , wider and larger then their other slip on loafers",2023-07-17,4.0,R34FUXX4BFJEKD,Hawkster,0.0,The shoes are not sturdy enough to “ slip on” as indicated.,Performance,2023-09-12,3.0

For me, this isn't a dealbreaker as I'm using them as a smart casual/rugged boot but if you're looking for something dressier, this won't be it.  I am looking forward to seeing how they uniquely age since the leather is easily marked and the patina is part of the appeal for me.I'm a size 10.5 converse wearer, size 11 running shoe and typically find I have to size down boots a half size.  I ordered these in a 10, and they're a bit large but not worth swapping for a 9.5 and riskkng them being too perfectly snug.  You do have to lace them a bit tighter since there are only two eyelets per side.They don't offer a ton of support and have a flat sole.

It's like my little style secret that doesn't break the bank.Durability-wise, these shoes hold up like champs. The quality materials and sturdy construction give them that rugged edge while ensuring they can handle whatever I throw at them. Rain, mud, you name it—they can take it and still look sharp.

I was recommended Cole Haan by a colleague.  I didn’t want to pay that much though so I gave these a try.  First impression is that they look kind of cheap.  I had to remove the shoelaces as they were not put in correctly and redo that.  Not a big deal.  Comfort wise they feel good at first.  The soles are extremely soft, but almost too soft.  It’s a weird feeling walking in them because my heels have a tendency to wear the inside portion of the heel over time.  I can feel it is exaggerated in these because the soles are so soft and I am not sure if that support would be good for me long term.  The “leather” looks cheap and a coworker actually said they look like plastic.  It’s not soft supple leather and it’s got a pleather appearance to them.  Almost a faky orange brown.  I also had a flashback to an old episode of Sponge Bob I watched years ago with my children when I wear them.  They squeak because of the materials rubbing together.  I still don’t know if I will keep them.  This is day one.  I also don’t know how long I should expect these to last.  The stitching looks pretty decent.Day 2 - the back of my heel hurts after doing steps.  the actual shoe part outside of the sole is not comfortable at all.  Still squeaking like crazy.

Why are they perfect for me?- they are squishy enough inside to give me a soft footfall.- they fit great but don't have snug toes- they stay on without trouble, yet have an opening at the ankle that is large enough to allow some swelling (because my feet swell every night a bit)- they look nice enough to wear to work and church but casual enough to wear anywhereAnd--I have pretty big feet (size 11) but they don't make my feet look like giant boats.

The rest of the shoe is well constructed, soft and comfortable. the back of the shoe is a stiff material so when you try to put the shoe on it can be a bit tricky. The opening is narrow with no zipper to make it larger. It will stretch open for you to slip your foot in.

I must say I was concerned about the water-proof claim as the uppers are mesh.  Rest-assured that they are leak-proof.  I came away after 9-holes of cart-path only with dry socks and feet.  Will need to clean the mud off but these Puma's passed the test.,Sharp Puma's -- Waterproof (Order 1/2 size smaller),2023-09-27,5.0,R3F4XVZYOVPGQX,Mike,3.0,"UPDATE:  Unfortunately (and despite my early experience of staying dry), The last few rounds I played the mesh was no longer water proof and my socks were very wet about 3 holes into the round (especially in the toe area).  This was not golf in the rain, the course was just wet from the night before.  Too bad... I still wear these shoes around town as they are comfortable and I like the way they look.  Other than the dryness issue, I like they way they perform on the course too.  Oh well... you get what you pay for.  -1 star from original of 4 stars.ORINGINAL REVIEW: I was going to wait a little while to review these shoes because of the previous questionable reviews.  However, yesterday sealed the deal for me!  Granted I only have about 10 rounds of golf on these so longevity is YTBD, but yesterday I played in the rain and mud with these shoes after a day when my area received 3.5"" of rain the day before.  The course was Muddy and WET and I was concerned that these shoes, being less expensive then some of the best reviewed, might not hold up.  Not only were my socks and feet bone dry at the end of the round but my feet felt great!  They shed water like a champ and even though they are spikeless, I felt no slippage on any shot (tee box or fairway).  From other reviews, it looks like there is a tendency for the laces to rip through the leather eyelets. I have been weary of that so the first few rounds I was ""careful"" not to pull too hard but the last few rounds I've been testing them a little more for durability.  So far, no problem.  Anyway, I try to leave reviews that help other consumers so here are the pros and cons readers digest version.  This is one mans opinion, YMMV.The golfer leaving the review:*Male - 6'2"" - 185lbs - size 12 medium*Mid 50's*Golf 3-5 times a week (12 Handicap)* Has owned numerous golf shoes from FootJoy and other well known brands.Pros*Comfortable (like, super-wear-all-day-type-comfortable)*Good looking if you like the sneaker vibe*so far, appear to do well in wet weather (UPDATE: 2 months in they are leaking!)*nice and cool on hot days*flexible upper mesh (see cons for same feature)*spikeless sole has provided good stability*fits this golfer's narrow foot but feels like it could be comfortable for wider fits.Cons*Still concerned about eyelets ripping (will report here if so)*May not provide great side to side stability for some golfers (Mesh upper not the same as shoes with leather upper)*Spikeless sole not an aggressive tread - aggressive golfers with faster swing speeds than I, may have issues.For $90.00 (and if the eyelets don't break) this is a great value in a golf shoe.  Took off one star only for the stability factor.",Surprising Performer - UPDATED AFTER 2 1/2 MONTHS,2021-07-11,3.0

Not only do they make every shoe fit better, but they don't exert the same force on the lace holes as traditional laces, so you shouldn't have a problem with the strap breaking.Couple things:1. The shoe I ordered was not the same as pictured. The picture has black/charcoal, plus  hot red/coral stripes. The one I received had black stripes but with the hot red lace holes/straps. Not a bad looking shoe, but not what I was looking for.2. I have this same exact shoe but in true red with black stripes that I bought back in 2020. They've been awesome shoes that I've worn sparingly because I like them so much I want to keep them for awhile, and I doubt they bring those back. They're super comfortable for casual wear and lots of standing or walking. I'm athletic build - 5'9"" @ 172 lbs, and the cushion is great. I don't run in these or workout, they're fine for a quick sprint or two, but I wouldn't buy these for running, they're not meant for that.On that note about my old pair - this shoe I just received is...different. So much so that I wasn't sure if it was authentic. I think it is now after looking around, but I'm still only like 85% sure.The foam insert for the insole says Cloudfoam on it, but my 2020's don't. OK fine, model upgrade, right? Yeah....but the one's on Adidas's current website don't say Cloudfoam, they just say ADIDAS - same as my '20 red ones. But they do say ""Cloudfoam comfort"" on the product description on the website. So it could be an older photo? OK...but they don't list this color combination (all black/charcoal with hot red lace loops) as an option. Also, this color option is very hard to find outside of Amazon. I checked Academy Sports, Famous Footwear, DICK's, and a handful of other reputable sites, and the only other place I found them was eBay. Not exactly a strong case for authenticity. So I'm really not sure what to think, but I'm not a professional shoe detective either...Those things wouldn't matter except for these shoes just aren't as comfortable as my 2020's. The foam insert isn't as comfortable, and I just vividly remember the ""aahhhh"" pillow comfort feeling of my 2020's when I slipped them on in the store. These were much more firm as far as my memory can tell.So I returned them. They're still fine if you love the color combo.",Not sure what to think,2023-04-05,3.0

I've had no problems with them, they fit great and I haven't seen any quality issues, no seams coming apart. If they made a version of these with a stiffer rock plate insert in them they'd be my perfect trail running shoe. Unfortunately the trails I run on are so rocky, that I am looking for another shoe with more protection. I am very careful how I run and where I step and I don't injure my heels as I land flat footed or on my toes. But some parts of the trails I run on there is nowhere to go to avoid golf ball sized rocks and I tend to hurt the balls of my feet as the rocks really poke through. You can definitely feel the trail and have great control, I have no worries about ankle sprains which has plagued me in the past before I went with minimal shoes. But the shoes are so flexible the impact of the rocks are starting to tear up the bottom of the insert and the minor injuries are keeping me from running as much as I'd like.

Based on prior reviews, many people clearly like these.  But they didn't work for me.This was my first experience with this kind of shoe.  In my 72 years, I've worn dress shoes, athletic shoes, sandals (Chacos are my top), and boots of all kind.  But never anything like this.  But I wanted something light weight for workouts with my flow ropes, so thought I'd try these out.UPS delivered mine about 11 am this morning. I wore them around my apartment for a few hours on hardwood floors, a bit of carpet, and a rubber kitchen mat.  By 3 pm, I'd decided to return them.  There are multiple reasons why, in no particular order.1) They are a PITA to put on.  Since there is no tongue, they don't open wide like shoes with a real tongue.  Worse, the loop on the back above the heel is so small that getting my index finger into it was difficult -- and I have small hands for man (I wear size small gloves).  If both ends of the loop were sewn on the outside, it would work.  But one end is outside, the other end inside, so it straddles the edge.2) I've been wearing size 9 everything for decades.  So I purchased size 9 (42) because they are reportedly true to size.  But these were at least an inch too long for me.  I guess I could have lived with it, but ...3) I laced them up very loosely -- actually time with the laces completely untied -- yet they felt very tight across the top of my foot (the ""bridge"" just forward from my ankle).  And that's even with my narrow feet (I'm a 9A.)  When sitting or lying in my hammock, I felt that my foot was going to go to sleep -- that tingling sensation.  I was wearing a lightweight sock -- lightest I had, so that contributed.  I know that most people wear these without socks, but I hate that, and these were not comfortable on my bare skin at all.  I suppose I could have ordered some thin, dress socks, but I really never wear that kind.4) This last factor is what made me decide to return them.  The top of the opening -- a lightly padded ""ridge"" -- rubs against my ankle on the outside of my foot -- the ankle ""bump"".  It was starting to chafe after only moderate movement (dance movements to simulate exercise).So, again, I'm not knocking the design -- lots of people like them -- nor the quality of materials or workmanship.  But they didn't work for me.  I'm going to order a new pair of Chacos and call it good.","Good quality shoes, but they didn't work for me",2023-02-24,3.0

The sizing is true to size, I would say.  If you're on the fence about these shoes, just go ahead and get them, you'll love them!  Just order your usual size.",Awesome shoes - True to Size - I should not have sized up.,2023-10-02,5.0,R47ERASTZEQHF,JC,7.0,"Loved the retro styling of these- the oxblood/wine color is gorgeous, the little punch-out details add flare and overall,  these look like a well-made, higher-end shoe. The chunky, 90s inspired lug sole seemed cute and practical, like it would be good for Fall/Winter.But- and why I sadly had to return them- they lack good padding in the ball of the foot and run too small and narrow in the largest available size (11). Can't add any type of insoles or cushions because there isn't any room. I bought these in part because the description mentioned extra support and cushioning but, honestly, I didn't notice much difference between these and any other standard, non-comfort type shoe. After less than 5 minutes my feet started to hurt from being pinched in the too-narrow toe box. Walking just a few paces on a thick carpet left my feet and calves sore from too little cushioning. Since these aren't leather, there's no chance they'll stretch out with wear to become more comfortable. Life's too short for painful shoes, so, sadly back these go.Would really like to see more fun, trendy styles like this in larger sizes (manufacturers generally seem to still think people with larger feet are all about 150 years old & have no interest in anything pretty, fun or stylish!) Not sure if a size 12 might've been more comfortable and/or worked better for me with an insole but at least having that as an option would've been nice.For the record, I'm about 5'10, medium build and usually wear a standard width size 11 in most shoes without needing to size up to a wide width or a 12. Thankfully, no foot health issues.These might be good for someone with a more narrow foot and/or someone who isn't looking for much in the way of cushioning and support in their footwear.",Looks great but runs narrow & lacks cushioning,2023-08-17,3.0

My own arch is rather high but that makes finding shoes exceedingly difficult. I adore Dansko but I think they look a tad clunky on the foot and are a bit on the expensive side. I think it's difficult to buy shoes online without being able to try them on. And I can make a tad big pair of shoes work but not a pair that are too tight.

The BOA system is very smooth and works well to lock in in seconds (and adjust throughout the round which I love and something I cannot/do not do with laces).CONS:  The Puma Ignites continue to run about a half size too long - not the biggest deal, but annoying.  This has been an issue for years with Puma's golf line that they are not addressing for some odd reason.  The biggest issue for me was the traction!  It is terrible.  The rubber compound they use on the outsole is soft and wearing quickly, and the nubs/spikes are not deep enough or spaced out enough in certain areas to grip the turf.  This has caused my left foot to slip during impact making me pull the shot on occasion which is NOT ok with me (RH, low single digit golfer).  They don't slip all the time, but do enough for me to deem the traction a failure for golf.  I have only played them during dry rounds too.  For comparison, I had a UA spikeless shoe before these and that traction was incredible even in wet weather.Big disappointment for me as I love the way they look and feel, but I do not want to wear them golfing any longer.","Very Comfortable, but sketchy traction!",2023-05-04,3.0

Hopefully that helps someone regarding measuring and a basis for this review and finding the right size for them. For some reason not everyone writes their stats to help them out. But for over a year I have been suffering from pain hip / back / knee. I am not, sadly, overly active anymore although I would like to say that I enjoy doing outside projects, but it has been difficult with my weight and the pain to be outside and moving around for a long period of time. I took about 2 months to research shoes, literally googling shoes for fat people / shoes for all day wear. The top two brands that kept popping up were these Brooks and Hokas. I found that both shoes can be bought for around the same price of $150 which is the most expensive pair of shoes I have ever bought except for dress shoes. But I decided to go with the Brooks because the one factor I noticed is these Brooks have support rails to help align my body. And as a side note it is definitely worth looking up how your legs and feet are aligned to find the right shoe. Asics have a good video on determining your foot alignment and stride. I tend to have my weight on my heels which leads to the outer edge and then to the toe area. And after buying these shoes for the first day that I put them on I can't believe how much this is changed my life in regards to getting my projects done without feeling sore nor tired. When I first read review saying it's like walking on clouds I thought people were exaggerating and they were not. Although they are not like fluffy memory foam pillows they are very lightweight and conforming. Honestly I just remember putting them on and I don't even feel like they're strapped to my feet. I am trying to take good care of these shoes as I normally break the back counters of My normal shoes. So I have a metal shoe horn and that helps easily and I just did a square knot to tie them quickly and permanently and I have yet to retie or adjust and it's been too much. I've also used the second eyelet in the top part of the shoe. I can literally be on my feet for hours without taking a break and without feeling tired or worn down. I self-diagnosed myself with plantar fasciitis after reading the symptoms. I know that sounds lame but all the symptoms I had matched those of plantar fasciitis and ever since wearing these shoes all of those symptoms have All but gone away. The support rails are definitely noticeable when first putting them on compared to a normal everyday tennis shoe for example. They are not intrusive nor can you truly feel them but they are noticeable in the support they give you when you first stand up. I initially thought that I would have troubles with the slope of the shoe but I have not encountered any issues with balance or performance. I cannot speak more highly about these shoes and I am now going to be a life-long customer for these shoes and the brand. I hope that they don't ever change the structure of these shoes but maybe one day they could make it truly feel like a cloud :-). The tread on them has not worn. And is very thick soled and seem to be nearly non-slip. I have not only completed a year's worth of small around the house projects around the house in the past 2 months but I'm excited to do more and be more active. I doubt I'll be running any marathons anytime soon but the fact that every time I put my shoes on I'm energized and motivated, I'm sure I will be back to living a healthier and more adventurous lifestyle in the coming year. For those looking for shoes if you're overweight and oddly disproportionate like me, these are the shoes for you!

So, I returned them and wanted to get the 8 instead of the 7.5. I had the shoe in my cart ready for when I got the refund on my Amazon account, I would order the shoe the same day. The next day when I was ready to order it...the price was 119! I was shocked and upset because I really liked the shoe. I emailed the company asking if they would be able to give me a discount or give me a replacement, and they said they don't do that. They say their pricing changes a decent amount due to consumerism and vendor pricing, but a $60 dollar difference?? Seems a little fishy to me. If this is their policy I will not order from this company again. It's not fair to have a customer order your product at a discount and the product turns up and is too small, or big, and then the NEXT DAY have the price double and not let that person return/exchange for the price they originally paid for. It is not the customers fault especially if they were like me and read all the reviews and made the decision that sticking with my size would be a good idea, only to find out it's a little too small for my need..IF you don't mind the policy, these shoes would be a 4 or 5 for me. but I just can't get past the fact they are going to have me pay double what I paid originally just because the shoes turned out to be smaller than expected.","2 not for the product itself, will not be ordering from",2023-02-01,2.0

They are comfortable out of the box, the laces are well designed to get the just the right hug of your foot.  I generally where thin socks and on the coldest winter days I may switch to thick ones and adjusting the laces is not hard to do at all.",My everyday work shoe,2023-09-11,5.0,R35Z16M0WVE8QA,El Avocado,3.0,"The Good:Leather (or leather like) interiors are very comfortable and as someone with feet on the wider side, needing of moderate arch support, spending 6 hours a day on my feet and 2 sitting down these did a great job. My work is fairly lightweight but does involve a lot of walking. I didn’t feel excessive fatigue and slipping them off without untying them effortlessly due to smooth interior is a plus at the end of the day. Though I’m not crazy about the style, I prefer a classic oxford with a capped off toe look, these aren’t the most hideous shoes I’ve worn, but certainly not the most attractive either. I did not mark down my review for style as I knew it was something I was getting into on purchasing. Other people have complained that the shoes are “noisy,” I’ve had absolutely no problems with stealthiness in my casual business style step.The Bad:These shoes seem to scuff fairly easily and due to the semi-squared toed design, scuffs seem to cover more of the shoe than I would like. If you want to maintain the illusion of professionalism they may require more shoe polish than your standard pointed toe oxford. If you are working in a strictly casual business environment these will probably be more than adequate, but if you need to more things, or bump into things in an uncoordinated manner such as myself, you will likely find you shoes looking worse for wear. These shoes do a terrible job for slip prevention, again, shouldn’t be a factor if you’re in an office, but anyone in the service industry should expect to be disappointed in this regard.The Ugly:One thing I expect from my shoes and my clothing is the ability to withstand basic use for extended periods of time. In a carpeted environment, spending approximately 6 hours a day on my feet, five days a week, these shoes only lasted me 4 or 5 months before wearing through the rubber on the bottom to a point where they no longer could keep out moisture. Price for performance I would give these shoes a very low score. I bought these shoes on sale for about $50, regular price $75, but still feel, for how long the shoes lasted me that even on sale, I still paid way too much.I bought a pair of Dr. Scholls Lug style shoe as a replacement, which I would describe as inferior to this shoe as far as comfort and pertinacity for wear, but superior in the factor of anti-slip for anyone that may be comparison shopping.I have a pair of Condor’s Wyoming Style work boots that have temporarily taken over for these more professional looking Dockers, I’d highly recommend those to anyone who is on their feet regularly with no one to impress.Good luck, men’s shoes seem to be a black hole of garbage for the most part.",These Shoes Have Quite a Bit Going For Them But...,2020-08-06,3.0

The inside padded sole is so soft and comfortable. They are easy to put on, easy to walk in, and didn't rub even when brand new. If you like Toms, you will especially like these - very similar style and comfort, at a fraction of the price. I like them so much that I am buying extra pairs to save for when the first pair wears out. But I don't think that will happen anytime soon. Go with your gut when choosing size, rather than whatever size Amazon recommends - I normally wear either a 6 or 6.5, and Amazon wanted me to buy a 6.5, but I wanted these to fit close and not be loose so I chose a 6 and wasn't disappointed.

I was commuting by car back in Long Island City, so I wore black fancy sneakers that didn’t draw much attention (the sneaker part could be hidden by my work pants) and changed into my stilettos for business meetings. When I first realized that my new commute would entail 2 buses (with 1 being a busy tuna-can like NYC MTA bus), I realized that I needed a comfortable middle ground, and less bags to carry; shoes that look professional and don’t require my stilettos. I found Cleo Skechers online and absolutely fell in love with the lace look! I can affirm that they are comfy, practical, are the perfect fit, and the memory foam makes a busy stressful work day so much more relaxing, feeling like you’re walking on air. I chose black and they are absolutely perfect for the office!

Not only does it offer exceptional comfort and support, but its sleek design and attention to detail make it a stylish choice as well.One of the standout features of the Puremotion shoe is its incredible comfort. The shoe’s cushioning system provides a plush feel, absorbing impact and reducing strain on my feet, even during long-distance runs. The responsive midsole ensures a smooth and energetic ride, enhancing my overall performance. The shoe also offers ample arch support, which has been a lifesaver for me as someone with high arches. It provides the right balance of stability and flexibility, promoting a natural stride.I also appreciate the lightweight construction of the Puremotion shoe. It feels almost weightless on my feet, allowing me to maintain a faster pace without feeling weighed down. The breathable upper mesh material keeps my feet cool and well-ventilated, preventing excessive sweating and discomfort during intense workouts. Additionally, the shoe’s flexible outsole adapts well to different surfaces, providing excellent traction and grip.The design of the Adidas Women’s Puremotion shoe is sleek and contemporary. The clean lines and minimalistic aesthetic give it a modern appeal that effortlessly transitions from a run to everyday wear. The variety of color options allows for personalization, catering to different style preferences. I have received numerous compliments on the shoe’s stylish look, both at the gym and while running errands.Durability is another strong suit of this shoe. The high-quality materials and solid construction ensure that it can withstand the demands of regular use. Even after several months of intense workouts and outdoor runs, the Puremotion shoe shows minimal signs of wear and tear, which speaks to its longevity.In conclusion, the Adidas Women’s Puremotion running shoe delivers on both performance and style.

Buying really expensive footwear, paying for custom insoles, knee braces, ankle braces, compression sleeves...all of it. I bought these shoes after doing some research and from the 1st day I wore them, everything changed. I can be on my feet for 10+ hours no with little to NO pain and I am not fatigued like I usually am after a long day at work. I would have never guessed it, but this blade design is genius. I dont think Ill ever own a different type of shoe. Now if you're dealing with rain or need to protect your toes then you should dress accordingly, but even with that small sacrifice Id say these shoes are worth every penny and more! Im buying more in different colors, I cant believe it.","Best $45 you will ever spend, period.",2023-10-01,5.0,R1SJEAPFBUKIQE,Genji Ooka,13.0,"I've been wearing issues for about 4 days now, wearing outside inside wherever I may go. They are comfortable, they feel different than normal shoes, the only thing I would say that I had an issue with these shoes, would be the hard material on the outside, it gets scratched very easily as you can see in the third picture.Now, This is on the inside like where both the feet would meet together. They've rubbed together quite often, I guess with the way that I walk. As you can see it does leave a scuff mark on the inside of the shoe. In the second picture, is the outside of the show which has very little to no scuff mark on them. So I have to come to the assumption that is from the shoes sliding together as I walk.Another thing about the shoes, I would probably say I'd change out the soul with another ones I have found on here on Amazon that I've come to like and put in almost all my shoes. Issues are usable for driving as well, I was low concerned about that with the fact that has a gap in the center of the bottom of the shoe, but I had very little issues with this. Just sitting in the driver seat a little bit and seeing how it felt against the pedals allowed me to accommodate my driving style if I needed to.The only thing I've not done avidly with these shoes would be running I'd say. So I can't see much for its durability test in running, but I have done a couple of quick jogs to get from point A to point B real quick. But overall, was putting in over 10,000 steps each day for the last 4 days, these shoes are very nice and do you keep my feet comfortable. The cloth material isn't interesting choice on the shoes and does allow for breathability within the shoes. I did get these shoes in a size 9.5, as as my shoe size, and they fit perfectly around my feet. So I'd say definitely get the size that you most comfortably wear avidly.",These are not bad for the price,2023-02-04,3.0

I had thin white crew socks on and could fit two fingers inserting in shoe behind my heel. That tells me I should of ordered a 7 & 1/2 wide. The width is perfect for my toes, they have wiggle room and big toe nor pinky toe rub against sides.  Instead of returning these and ordering a 7 & 1/2  wide I am just going to wear thicker socks. I am afraid if I go with 1/2 size smaller then my heel will rub on back of shoe and toes will hit top of shoe.As for comfort just wearing them around indoors, my feet did not hurt however I have not worn them outside on asphalt yet because of it being a rainy day. Also I have Plantar Fushia so needed a walking shoe that had good arch support and so far I believe these shoes do. I bought these to specifically do walking in because I want to get back in shape and drop some extra weight. The true test is when I actually can get my walking in to see if they still provide comfort and keep my feet from hurting. The only negative is I feel the shoes are a over priced for wide width. I could see maybe $5.00 or $10.00 extra but $15.00 extra is ridiculous. I also feel real leather should have been used for trimming especially for the price of these walking shoes.

One person said ""Color was the only difference between them.""  THAT IS NOT TRUE.  There ARE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES in the sole.  V12 is a tiny fraction narrower than V13.  That makes the  V12 toe box slightly smaller as well, so a thinner sock works.This shoe is considered  ""neutral"" in support ***.

As we get older our feet and the type of support may change.  Had I known 30 yrs ago what I've learned this past year, I would never have bought many of the shoes I wore in the past.

I am a clumsy person and I can tell you with confidence that I never slipped once while wearing these shoes, no matter how much water, milk or soap was on the floor.These shoes look nice, the all-over black look is very professional. If they get dirty, I just wiped them down with a cleaning wipe and they looked fine again.These shoes are water resistant, maybe even water proof. I have spilled so much hot coffee on them and my toes have remained dry and unburned.These shoes have no laces than need to be tied, so they cannot become untied and you won't trip on the laces.Cons: there is almost no support in these shoes. The sole is hard as a rock and your feet will hurt after working a full shift.Like all clothes, these loosen up over time. They are slip on shoes, so they're not really meant to be tight anyway, but there is noticeable gaping around my ankle now, my foot moves a lot in my shoe.The combination of a hard, flat sole and a loose fit is now causing me problems. My foot pain after work is now lasting several days, if I happen to have time off. I tried using an insole to add some cushion, but with such a loose shoe, the added bulk just made my foot slide off the insert, leading to a new kind of soreness after my shift.I've developed cuboid syndrome and require manual manipulation and wrapping to manage my pain. This may have been avoided if I replaced my shoes earlier, but I've always had a hard time with that. If there are no actual holes, I will keep wearing a pair of shoes.Would I buy these shoes again? Probably not these exact ones, but another pair from Sketchers, a pair with laces I can tighten as the shoe gets more worn. My advice is to skip these exact shoes, but stick with this brand. They are perfectly non-slip and water-resistant in my experience, but they require more padding, some arch support and definitely the ability to tighten them down the more you wear them.","Non-slip, water-resistant.

These  11s are the best Asics update in a LONG time and while the changes are subtle they make a significant difference in the experience.FIT: The GT line has had a very consistent architectural fit over the years and the 2000-11s continue that.  Sizing is consistent with prior models. Just the right placement and height of the arch, excellent shape of the heel and forefoot, trademark dual-zone pronation correction. If earlier GT models fit your feet well, so will these.TOE BOX: In recent iterations (including the 2000-9s), Asics has slightly narrowed the toe box. While it wasn't enough on me to lead to blistering, it was noticeable and just slightly uncomfortable on longer runs as my feet swelled. The 2000-11 has returned just enough width to the toe box that it solves the issue for me.  Great fit in a true D width that keeps your forefoot contained without being too tight or too roomy.WEIGHT / RIDE: The 2000-11s are lighter than past models thanks to new FlyteFoam Blast in the midsole, which is softer and lighter than previous materials. It's a small difference (0.2 ounces compared to the 2000-9s) but it's noticeable.  The shaping of the sole also promotes a better foot strike with smoother landings and transitions, avoiding the clunkiness that came with the 2000-9s. With the 2000-9s I was conscious of the shoe in my gait.  With the 2000-11s it feels much more natural and integrated into my foot/stride.UPPER: Asics continues to thin out the uppers with next-gen woven materials. But they've done an excellent job here.  No hotspots, the finish is attractive. Plenty of flex and stretch. The laces are thinner and flatter, both minimizing pressure points at the tongue and keeping them tied better. There is some slight lengthwise flexion/creasing in the upper around the toe box that might lead to wear and tear, but so far not a significant issue. The upper heel is still very well cushioned and silky smooth, which means blisters should not be a problem around the achilles area.COLORWAYS: In my opinion, the only real weak spot for the line.  None of the colorways are all that distinctive or appealing.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with the sage green.  Having grown tired of dark grays and navy, and not wanting to go loud with bright electric colors, I was left with sage as the only light option.  In the product photos the sage has almost a camo/khaki tinge making it look a little dirty or worn.  In person it's much closer to a cool sage, which I find really nice.OVERALL: I've been extremely happy with the 2000-11s.  With the 2000-9s I was suffering mild-to-moderate quad soreness after long runs, which I attribute to the slightly clunky ride. I have had zero issues in the 2000-11s and actively look forward to being able to lace them up and take them out. They fit my feet perfectly, are pleasant to run in, and leave me feeling fresher than my previous trainers did. Highly recommend, especially if you have run in previous GT models and know they fit for you.",EXCELLENT.

This style of shoes well fits that bill when you select options without white soles.I'll talk about two pairs I bought (from different sellers) because they are essentially the same knit style with slight variations in how they utilize the mesh sections. The first is the Pozvnn ""Mens Slip-on Tennis Shoes Walking Running Sneakers Lightweight Breathable Casual Soft Sole Mesh Work Gym Trainers"" in all green; then, I purchased thIs LCGJR shoe in all brown.First, I'll say that this style is very comfortable. The knit allows the shoes to expand where needed to enhance comfort (unlike leather shoes that will stretch some over time but mostly force the foot to deal with its firm structure).  Secondly, the dark green and dark brown colors are rich and vibrant; and the soles in each case match the knit exactly, something I have learned cannot be taken for granted.Now, to contrast the shoes, starting with sizing. The Pozvnn shoe matches what I am used to for my size. This shoe is a half to a full size bigger in length & width. (See photo comparing soles of the two shoes.)The insole of the Pozvnn shoe is quite comfortable, superior to this shoe's (pictured).  The inserts in both are the same general perforated style with a thin nylon topper, but the perforated piece in the Pozvnn shoe provides better padding (more spring) and the top layer is a bit thicker and of a better grade. I know from experience with some inserts similar to this shoe's insoles that the top layer will likely begin to separate soon, bunch up and have to be removed, leaving just the perforated layer which is uncomfortable on a bare foot.  Fortunately, because this shoe runs large, I could add some cushy inserts I already own, enhancing the comfort.The other significant issue has to do with the tongues and the finishing of the rim. The Pozvnn shoes are nicely finished, with no exposed place where fabric overlaps (which bodes well for how the fabric will wear). These shoes have a trim that goes around the top...which means that there will be a place where the two ends of the trim meet. And that is a problem because it wasn't done well on either of these LCGJR shoes (see photo).Perhaps the manufacturer thought the sloppy finish would go unnoticed because the ends meet under a flap displaying the company logo. I likely wouldn’t have seen this issue for a while; but since I’m using these shoes for dressy casual, I removed the flaps (easily detached with a seam ripper). Basically, the flaps offer no structural support for the trim; they just provide advertising and a cosmetic covering.Now, you may wonder why I didn't buy another pair of Pozvnn shoes since they are comfortable without inserts, more accurately sized and better finished around the top. To be honest, I would have bought more Pozvnn shoes had they been available in brown.  Still, I do not regret buying these LCGJR shoes.  I really like the look and the warm, deep brown color. However, I would not recommend buying them unless you have (or are willing to buy) inserts and unless you or someone you know can address the problem if (likely, when) the ends of the trim come loose. It's definitely fixable (easiest if you do it before the unraveling begins), but best done by someone who has experience with such mending.[Note: I have rated these shoes a ‘4’ because I had inserts and the ability to address the mending issue. Had that not been the case, I would have rated them a ‘3’.]",Quite comfortable…when you add inserts,2023-03-18,4.0,R33K7LNQOKASZM,Vladimir Stefanovic,0.0,"Not a fan, sorry. The heal part of the sole was good. But towards the front, it was very thin and it almost felt like there was Factory defect because every time I would step on my toes first, it's as if I felt some bumps underneath instead of a nice flat surface inside the shoe. Not sure if this is making any sense, I just had to return it because it's not for me.",Almost 😢,2023-09-21,3.0

As an avid runner, finding the right balance between lightweight design and adequate support has always been a challenge for me, but these shoes hit the mark.First and foremost, the comfort level is outstanding. The cushioning provided by the insoles is soft yet responsive, making each stride feel like a breeze. I've taken them on both short jogs and longer runs, and my feet have never felt fatigued or strained afterward. The shoes seem to mold to my feet, providing a snug and cozy fit that enhances the overall running experience.Despite their lightweight construction, these shoes do not compromise on support. The arch support is surprisingly robust, giving my feet the stability they need during high-impact activities. I've noticed a significant reduction in any discomfort or strain on my arches and ankles, which is crucial for injury prevention and overall performance improvement.The breathability of these shoes is another commendable feature. Even during intense workouts, my feet stay cool and dry thanks to the well-designed ventilation system. This feature adds to the overall comfort and helps me stay focused on my run without any distractions.The durability of the shoes is also worth mentioning. After several weeks of consistent use, including running on various terrains, the shoes still look and feel brand new. The outsole provides excellent traction, ensuring a secure grip even on slippery surfaces.In conclusion, these Men's Running Shoes have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, lightweight design, and support.

Some reviewers even said that they thought they were not authentic on Amazon. I am glad that I still purchased them and didn’t allow those reviewers to influence my decision to still get them. The first two pair worked great to wear while having lumbar disk back issues and a total knee replacement. I appreciated the stability and how they did not aggravate my conditions.These third ones I purchased have all the same benefits as the first pairs I purchased and more. The first two were comfortable but these new ones are ultra comfortable but still light and perfect to use for my new diagnoses of psoriatic arthritis.

They are comfortable, they feel different than normal shoes, the only thing I would say that I had an issue with these shoes, would be the hard material on the outside, it gets scratched very easily as you can see in the third picture.Now, This is on the inside like where both the feet would meet together. They've rubbed together quite often, I guess with the way that I walk. As you can see it does leave a scuff mark on the inside of the shoe. In the second picture, is the outside of the show which has very little to no scuff mark on them. So I have to come to the assumption that is from the shoes sliding together as I walk.Another thing about the shoes, I would probably say I'd change out the soul with another ones I have found on here on Amazon that I've come to like and put in almost all my shoes. Issues are usable for driving as well, I was low concerned about that with the fact that has a gap in the center of the bottom of the shoe, but I had very little issues with this. Just sitting in the driver seat a little bit and seeing how it felt against the pedals allowed me to accommodate my driving style if I needed to.The only thing I've not done avidly with these shoes would be running I'd say. So I can't see much for its durability test in running, but I have done a couple of quick jogs to get from point A to point B real quick. But overall, was putting in over 10,000 steps each day for the last 4 days, these shoes are very nice and do you keep my feet comfortable. The cloth material isn't interesting choice on the shoes and does allow for breathability within the shoes. I did get these shoes in a size 9.5, as as my shoe size, and they fit perfectly around my feet.

The toe box in the Wide width is perfect for my feet, with no squeezing or pressure. For reference, the 10W measures about 3.75"" across the widest point of the ball of the foot (3.5"" sole, but the leather has some give to it). The flat notch at the back of the heel avoids putting undue pressure on the Achilles tendon. Although the footbed is contoured and would probably be fine for someone with flat feet, there isn't a lot of internal arch support for those of us with higher arches. Fortunately, the sides of the shoes are high enough to accommodate inserts (my orthotics are elevated about 1.2"" at the arch and they fit fine in these without showing above the leather upper, as you can see in the photos). The leather soles are scored but still very slick, so if you aren't using these for dance where you need low friction movement, you'll probably want to add some adhesive traction pads.Bonus: They double as attractive business casual/dress shoes, and the low heel makes them comfortable enough for all-day wear.

I didn't use the enclosed applicator, but used old, cut up cotton t-shirts instead, my applicators and polishers of choice.Now, what didn't I like about this product?  First, the smell.  I am sensitive to many fragrances and this one, although not heavy, is not pleasant to me.  Don't know how to describe it as I haven't come across anything that smells like this before.  Second, the ingredient list is a bit disappointing.  It reads, ""Main Ingredients: Refined lanolin, leather nourishing liquid, leather shining agent, fragrance, etc.""  I really like to know what I am working with, and this ingredient list just doesn't cut it.",Gives new life to leather,2023-10-04,4.0,R3GCQEFLWVWQAY,Clay Shannon,0.0,"As you can see, this shoe polish does produce a nice sheen and shine — the images I included show my boots before I polished them, then afterward; I also added a photo of the canister of shoe polish (which had some shoe polish on the outside of it, thus preparing my fingers for polishing, which was unintended and unwanted). The photo of the box shows evidence of the shoe polish explosion (or leakage, anyway) that occurred somewhere along the line.On a less perturbing note, both the canister and the container contain typos: ""Effec"" should be ""effect"" and ""Nurishing"" should presumably be ""nourishing,"" although I'm not sure it could be said the footwear eats the shoe polish, exactly. The less-than-stellar orthography doesn't matter much, perhaps, as one knows what is meant by these near-misses, but it does make me wonder about the degree of pride Salty Fish (which is the name of the shoe polish maker) takes in their work. After all, as H. Wads Longfellow wrote in his poem ""The Builders"":“Nothing useless is, or low;Each thing in its place is best;And what seems but idle showStrengthens and supports the rest.. . .In the elder days of Art,Builders wrought with greatest careEach minute and unseen part;For the Gods are everywhere”I am not dinging Salty Fish for their typos, but I am knocking off a couple of points for the shoe polish leakage.As a side note, the aroma of the shoe polish is rather pleasant, but I don't know if this was because it has an inherently pleasant smell or because a note of nostalgia wafted through the room as I was transported back to past decades when my dad (a fireman and later a police officer) often blacked his shoes in the living room after dinner.","Effective shoe polish, but the packaging was a bit sloppy",2023-09-27,3.0

My first New Balance walking shoes I bought at an Academy Sports store in the Houston area, and they fit perfectly from day one. Then we  moved to the Texas Hill Country. Then I bought a pair of 493V3 ones-that have a lot of fabric to them, and they also fit perfectly, and I still have those-although they have a hole in a toe from using a toe separator for a time that was too wide. Then I ordered the New Balance 411V1 on Sept. 14, 2021 and they also  fit perfectly, and I still wear them and have them on now,  but there’s a lot of dirt out at our new house, and they’ve gotten dirty, and cleaned them, but this dirt just doesn’t get completely out! SO..I wanted a brand new pair that I would never go outside in! (I’ve always ordered white ones). BUT these are the first ones that seemed too small in the toe area, and by the middle of the day they hurt my toes so bad that I had to take them off and wear my older shoes. I gave them plenty of chances-although all my other New Balance shoes NEVER hurt any part of my feet-EVER!! So I’ve already returned them, and ordered another pair. Will send an update on those when I get them. By the way, my shoe size is 6 1/2 medium in all of them. Even the ones that I’ve returned.",First New Balance 411V1 that didn’t fit!,2023-09-17,3.0

The only issue is that the zipper on the back of the shoes broke on me waaaaay too quickly, making them unusable. They only fit when the zipper is up all the way, and they like to slide down due to a lil itty bitty tiny thing call ""gravity"". There's not enough tension at the neck of the shoe to keep your foot in place, so when the zipper is down, the shoe feels twice as large as it is. A locking system would have been cool. The only way I'm able to wear them now is by modding the zipper so it doesn't move, but then whats the point of having a zipper on the back of the bloody shoe?Overall, they're just ok. If you just need something cheap and stylish for like an hour? Theyre perfect.

I have tried a couple and the last one I got worked well unfortunately I couldn't find it again. I decided I would try this set, which allows the user to adjust the thickness, by adding or removing sections of the gel wedges. They are easy to put in, you just remove a piece of film that is attached to the adhesive side of the wedge and place them on top of each other, then into your shoes. They were comfortable standing stationary. The gel cradled the heel nicely. My problem was when I walked the insert would move under the arch of my foot, and irritate me. I have heavy duty double sided tape (which I used on my old inserts to keep them from sliding) so I lined the bottom of the insert with it in hopes that it would keep it in place.

I was getting tired of moving them from one pair of shoes to another, and since the closest GF store is now over 2 hours away, I thought I'd try these.  I have plantar fasciitis/ flat feet and was fitted at GF.  I have to say that these are not the same at all.  With price being entirely disregarded, the GF orthotics have a heel cup and lifted sides to cradle my foot, whereas Natural Foot is flat all around, which is unfortunate.  Natural Foot is much firmer and provides more arch support though.  The biggest difference is WHERE the support is.  GF has the arch support closer to the forefoot/ball, and NF has the arch support closer to the heel.  I found that the firmer support closer to the heel in the NF provides better pain relief in my arches.If you really want to make the most of your orthotics though, use a good brand of walking/hiking shoe that is supportive.  I find Keen and Merrell to be very durable and supportive, and they fit orthotics very well.

I should have immediately sent them back due to the undeserved cost, but they're still in my closet.  My opinion is they should sell for $30.

They have a great stretch and they’re very comfortable. I’d have to say they’re somewhat true in size because while they do fit me perfectly, the pink and green are made of different material from each other. The pink skirt is thicker and sturdier so there’s more tummy control and the skirt itself runs a bit short. The green one is a much thinner fabric and the safety shorts are similar to a t-shirt fabric and the skirt itself is a bit longer than the pink one. Not sure if I got a defective one but thought it was good to note for purchasers to watch out for the fact that not all the skirts are made the same. I’m waiting for the black one to come so I’m hoping it’s made with the fabric of the pink skirt but the length of the green. Another note I have is that if you have a longer pelvic area, the skirts will show all. The end of the skirts come right to the end of my butt so if I bend over, I am definitely exposed.

The top part is also wonky with sizing and may not fit properly without tailoring.Also, with wearing for two days my ribs are sore from wear with how thin the boning is, it’s odd how I could flip the bottom half of my corset up to use the restroom as that’s impossible with more well made ones.Overall, the price is decent and I love the design of it so it’s a keeper for me personally.

I even washed all of them (which is why I didn't return to Amazon), didn't dry them in the dryer but hung them and added a weight to them while they air dried.  Didn't help at all.  Still extremely tight and my head isn't large.  I just have a normal sized head.  The picture shows a headband that's comfortable on my head and one of the washed headbands I tried to stretch.  There's about an inch difference.  I'm hoping this company will read this review and make just a small change in size for us normal sized head people.  I'll have to check and see now if they make an XXL headband because other than them being tight, I love the style!",Great customer service!,2023-09-09,5.0,R1ORVAI3DFOTQC,DD,2.0,"At first I was excited because these actually fit my head without pinching as much as others. Hooray I thought!Wrong. They do not stay on, they slowly slip and I’ve even lost one while walking with my dog. (My hair was in a ponytail so I didn’t notice right away). I have very straight hair so idk if this has somehow affected their ability to stay on. It shouldn’t but worth mentioning.Quality is great and they’re very substantial but they’re not for people with bigger heads. 😂My search for a head wrap continues…",Not for people with big heads :(,2023-07-31,3.0

My only problem was the jacket fit perfectly like a medium should, and then the pants were like a small they were so tight and because of that canvas backing on the butt, it’s just there’s no give at all! I could get them on and zip them up and button the waist and the legs were fine but right at the top of the thigh and in the hip area and the butt area it was super restrictive. I got them for me and I am a 5’7” 143 pound female and I normally wear a men’s small to medium and usually with a medium. I have room to spare, but these were like for a child or some thing they were just so small I had my husband who is shorter than me and really tiny in the butt area. try to try them on and he could not even get them up or button them so that tells you something. I think this is something that tidwe needs to look at. And, unfortunately you have to order these as a set so I ordered the large and I guarantee you the jacket will be too big and the pants will probably fit perfect which sucks because you don’t want your clothing being too big for hunting getting your rifle or shotgun hung up in it can cause you to miss the shot of a lifetime. This is my feedback and I think they should allow you to order tops and bottoms and whatever combination you want considering the outcome that I have had it would’ve been really helpful to have a medium jacket and a large pant I guess since they do run small on the pants and the jackets are accurate to size. Hope this helps somebody.",Pants are not sized accurately,2023-06-20,3.0

I failed to research the current description, which says Oxford cloth now incorporates man-made fibers including polyester and other synthetics and that Oxford is mainly a type of weave.The cloth these bags are made of is definitely a blend, at best, and may not include any cotton.  And it seems to be coated with something.I could not spare the time to return the bags, and it also seemed pointless as measurements are apparently not trustworthy and the type of fabric can be anything.After so few days of use, I don't know if they will be sturdy or durable.

For starters, the fabric is not the same as the other products this company like the leggings and rompers. It’s like a thinner and cheaper version, doesn’t feel thick like the other products. Then, the material snags on things really easy. When I tried on one of the tops, my bracelet snagged on it and pulled out a long fray and I was kind of upset about that. I guess I could have been more careful but this bracelet hardly ever snags on my clothes :(  Also, the fit is weird. I got a large and they still fit pretty short and the arm holes fit awkward and kind of small, digs into your armpits a bit. To top it all off, the colors weren’t accurate :(  the brown was more of a medium muted brown rather than a deep chocolate brown and the white was more of a flesh tone instead of a white cream color.

Lots of different dresses, shoes, bags and a few brushes.The best of the bunch were the 4 sequined dresses, the other 4 dresses, and the 4 gowns.  The sequin dresses feel very sturdy and there was a lot of care taken in making them.  They all fit well.  One had an issue with the velcro on the back, not being sown in very tight, so it shows down the doll's back.The 4 other dresses fit well, and they can even fit on Curvy Barbie, which is something that everyone is hunting for, but seldom find.  The material is nice and sewn well.  The two bikinis that come with the set are fine.  The black and white one definitely fits better than the red, shiny bikini.  Both had some extra threads hanging off that were easily trimmed.The four ""wedding dresses"" fit really well. Again, something that curvy Barbie can wear.  The white/purple dress, and the purple-flowered dress are styled in the front, but the backs are plain white.  It would have been nice to see the colorful fabric follow all the way around.  The light pink and white dress is my favorite of the bunch,  It is a nice soft material that fits well.The remaining 6 dresses are printed designs, similar to the basic styles clothes that Barbie comes with.  They are only sewn down the sides, so they do not have a lot of shape to them when on the dolls.  A few of them had their hems close to the edge, and one of them had a seam open before the outfit was tried on the doll.  They are also ridiculously difficult to get on the dolls.  It took forever to get the dress on the doll with posed arms.  It was not much easier for the articulated dolls.  A piece of velcro in the back would have made getting them dressed a whole lot easier.There is a huge selection of shoes.  25 pair of shoes.  They are very stylish.  Most work well with the colors of the dresses.  They all fit the dolls.  There is only a pair of flip flops for flat feet. The rest are high heeled.The hangers are great.  The brushes are small and work well.  The handbags are a wide range of styles.  They can come apart in half to store things inside.  There is some flashing along the edges of a few of the purses that will need to be cleaned off with a sharp knife.Overall, this is a great set for someone that wants to fill up a Barbie closet.  There is a wide range of outfits for any activities that Barbie and her friends want to do.  From a tea party, to a fancy party, this set has you covered.  And who doesn't want more shoes?  There are a few sewing issues, but not bad when it is 2-3 errors in 16 dresses.","Great selection, even for Curvy Barbies",2023-08-10,4.0,RODKMKMFLQ0A9,Allie,0.0,some of the shoes don't fit but all of the clothes do and my daughter loves the new outfits for her barbies :),Ehh....,2023-08-11,3.0

It actually exceeded my expectations, especially for the fit and wear & tear you will put it through, as it is a Carhartt. Carhartt means, it was made to be USED and not just worn.  Any man will know the difference between wearing something and actually using it.I have about a Medium size to slightly medium-large sized head. Medium because of the shape and size of my head is Medium like anyone else with a medium sized head.  However, the large part is because the vertical length of my head is slightly longer.  Kind of like your shoe size may really be a size 10, however because you may have wide feet you have to get a size 11 just to accommodate the width, if a size 10W isn't available.If you're looking for a Medium sized hat with a little bit of length to it, then this would be the hat to get.Realistically, the hat is slightly a little bigger because of the length and its new.  However for a Man, it's always good to purchase a hat that is slightly bigger than what you presumably need, because you never know what your going to be stuck doing, like a lot of shoveling or out scraping cars when it's ice cold out and you need that extra part/length of the hat to cuff and cover your ears really well to keep them warm and protected.If you put this hat on all the way w/o cuffing it, and wear/pull it all the way down until there is no more to material to pull down, it will reach to about the base of the head/neck, with still a little slack left over.In terms of long term use and durability, this is also another reason why I love this hat.  As it does have slightly a little extra slack to it.  Depending on your purpose, occupation or whatever the heck you'll be doing that you'll be wearing this hat, it can be adjusted in many different positions.You'll also more than likely you'll end up putting it in the wash.  When you wash this hat, I highly recommend washing it only with other winter type articles of clothing, or maybe a small load of shirts or sweaters at most.  Yes, you could wash it with just a regular full load of laundry or anything else, but I don't recommend it if you want this hat to last a long time. Like anything else in this life, If you take care of it, it will take care of you. The best way to dry it would either be to throw it in the dryer for 5 minutes at the most and let it hang dry. However, if you want to dry it in the dryer all the way, put it on very light heat for about 10 to 15 minutes, or just let the dryer run on air dry with no heat for about 20 to 30 minutes. If you drive too much, that will get more worn Out and used then if you were wearing and using it yourself, which means it won't last long.This is my 2nd year purchasing this exact hat, as I still have the 1st hat from last year.  Except this time/year, I purchased 2 more from Amazon.The 1st hat was purchased at a retail location.  Then I found it online at Amazon for a fraction of the price.  I was hesitant at 1st, because the price on Amazon was substantially lower.  However, when I received these from Amazon, upon further examination, it was the same exact one that I purchased at retail.I purchased additonally hats because I have a habit of losing them. When you find a product or item that works well, especially a winter hat, it's a good idea to purchase a few extra ones.If you lose the only one that you have or if you've really got some really good use out of the one that you have had for a long time and you know it's more than likely it's time for you to throw it out, you know it's going to be close to impossible to find another one again that works exactly like the one that you had and grown accustom to that you know that works. We all know that all good things come to an end  it don't last forever. Then before you know it, your stuck having to go from store to store (site-to-site) to try to find a hat that fits or is comfortable, especially in the middle of winter when you just lost your hat. To top it off, you can no longer find that same exact hat. I've been through that before and it sucks.So in closing this is a very good hat, because of the good comfortable fit, durability, longevity and that It will take good care of you; and especially for the price.  You can't beat the price for the brand that you're getting which also makes it easier to buy extra hats.If you're going to buy extra hats, I recommend buying at least 2 or 3 extra or total of 3 or 4 hats. 1 hat for obvious reasons; an extra 1 at home in case you lose 1, 1 extra one for in your car under your seat in case you forget your hat or lose it while you're out and abou, that way you have an extra one in the car when you need it.

Weatherproof, resist water.",0.0,R2XDUNJMYFYIST,JS,21.0,"I did a lot of research on the many different roof top bags available on Amazon, and settled on this one for its good reviews and fair price.  I was uncertain at first if this bag would technically work with our car, as some product reviews and even direct answers from the seller in the Customer Questions indicate that it would not work with an Odyssey with no roof rack.  To make sure though, I called the company directly, and the person I talked to at Rightline assured me the bag would work fine for our car.  I also found a youtube video of an owner of a Honda Odyssey just like ours who bought and used this bag with good success.  After seeing that video, I decided to buy it.  We used it last week for a 1,000 mile round trip beach vacation - we needed extra space because we were dropping my son off at college on the way back.  The bag itself is very thick, tough material.  The zippers are a little tough to work at first, but I was fine with it with the understanding that probably made them more weatherproof.  We did not use any kind of pad underneath, and honestly, I don't know why you would need one, as the bag secures very well to the roof after tightening the straps and the underside of it is not abrasive.  On our way down, we drove through 5+ hours of heavy rain, and everything inside the bag was bone dry when we arrived at our destination.  However, because we dont have a roof rack, we had to attach the bag through the doors (note, this works fine even with sliding doors...).  This shouldn't be a problem in dry weather, other than a little extra wind noise.  However, the straps and buckles create small gaps in the doors, and water steadily dripped inside our car at all 4 attachment points.  It was not pouring in, but with 5 hours of rain, a steady drip adds up and is quite annoying, with seats, floors, and doors getting constantly wet.  That's my only complaint...Other than the rain issue, I think the bag is very high quality, secures well to the roof of your car, keeps your stuff dry, and will last a long time.","Works with a Honda Odyssey with no roof rack, with one caveat",2021-08-17,4.0,R34AU4EUOLJLE0,_NextLvlGaming,0.0,"This was everything I was looking for... until we got to day 3.  At that point, the entire side of the unit tore.  Luckily it was well constructed enough to not spill the contents over the road but it did make the rest of the trip very tight as we had to pile everything into the car.  I went with this unit based on previous reviews saying how durable it was.  I am not sure if my experience is the rule or the exception but I was able to return it for a full refund.","It was great, until day 3 of our cross country road trip",2023-08-17,2.0

I mean that literally, not metaphorically. For the past 15 years I've had pretty formidable alopecia, and at this point, no matter what I do, it's impossible to have a good hair day. No amount of washing, styling, cutting, barrettes, scrunchies or styling products is going to turn twelve limp strands into huge, voluminous sexy hair. Ach, life!  Because of that, I rely on hats to both hide the follicle exodus and create some alternative visual interest up in the head area...but there are more problems, in that I'm a large gal with a strangely-shaped body and face like a lump of bread dough, and most hats either don't fit or look horrible on me. It's really hard to find a hat with the exact right proportions to be flattering. I've been rotating the same 4 hats constantly for years now, but none of them are summer hats -- they're all dark, wintery materials -- and so, this month, I went on an Amazon Hat Quest, ordered five that I thought might work for summer or multiple seasons, and tested them out.This hat, people. This is the hat I was meant to find. I am in LOVE.This porkpie hat is like a fresh breeze blowing in from a small-town lake where little duck families paddle and quack, and a wee boy runs through the grass, trying to get his very first kite up into the air, and somewhere in the distance, a barbershop quartet is sweetly singing.  It's light and breathable, yet still quite sturdy -- I've packed it in a carry bag and it retains its shape -- and it really does exude a sense of summer whimsy. The proportions are perfect -- I tried a couple other boater/porkpie/skimmer straw hats, and either the brims didn't stick out far enough to read as that style, or the crowns were too short and didn't hug my head at all. This hat has room to be pushed down on one's head so that it stays put, and has enough brim to create some shade. It comes with a little baggie of several different feathers to decorate the attached ribbon (what a cute touch!), but it also works great with a colorful scarf tied around it, which is what I tend to do for fun. But the best part of this hat is the cleverness of the secret feature. Shhhhh, lean in close!! Are you ready?On the inside of the hat there's a fabric sweat band -- which is a great feature on its own -- but tucked under the sweat band is a thin strip of velcro that attaches to its velcro mate, sewn in place on the hat. That thin strip can be relocated along the in-place velcro to make the fit of the hat tighter or looser -- basically like pulling in the inside circumference of the hat a little bit -- and it really works! It's so flipping clever, and you'd never know it was there if you didn't know it was there! Whoever designed that feature deserves a raise, and at least one free hat.I'm probably going to have to get at least one more of this hat in another color, I love it so much.

The height is described as 12"".  It measures a bit over 11"".  I did not bother to measure the width.I also wanted to avoid as much plastic as possible and was happy that the description said ""Oxford fabric"".  When I was young, Oxford ""cloth"" was cotton.  I failed to research the current description, which says Oxford cloth now incorporates man-made fibers including polyester and other synthetics and that Oxford is mainly a type of weave.The cloth these bags are made of is definitely a blend, at best, and may not include any cotton.  And it seems to be coated with something.I could not spare the time to return the bags, and it also seemed pointless as measurements are apparently not trustworthy and the type of fabric can be anything.After so few days of use, I don't know if they will be sturdy or durable.  I have no idea what 'sheerness' is supposed to be about.  The plastic 'windows' are clear, naturally.","Bags seem okay, but description is *wrong*.",2022-02-06,3.0

This skirt is not.  I'm sure if I had read more about this particular garment, I would have discovered several of my complaints and not ordered this skirt, so really my issues are my own fault.Because its mostly white, it seems sheer looking at it in indoor lighting.  I wear leggings under most of my skirts to stay warm (and boots), so I have mixed reservations about this skirt.  Because the way my body is shaped, when I walk, the skirt moves up my body.  This means the slit that is supposed to help you walk creeps up to my butt.  I also have really long strides, which I'm sure doesn't help that either.The skirt is fitted and pull on.  This at least helps with moving the slit to the side, or over my thigh.  The fabric I think is like the 'scuba' fabric?  It's stretchy, but nicer than t-shirt fabric.  I don't know much about it but when it stretches, the pattern isn't completely distorted.  I'm not sure if it's because it's on a white fabric.  It washed just fine, and I hung it up to dry.I guess overall I'm just disappointed, and I should have returned it, but I didn't.

These cloths are more than just baby essentials; they’ve become a cherished part of our daily routine.First and foremost, the quality of these burp cloths is exceptional. They are made of 100% cotton, which not only feels incredibly soft but also provides outstanding absorbency. No more worrying about spit-ups and messes; these cloths handle them like a pro.The size is perfect at 20’‘x10’’, offering ample coverage to protect your shoulder or lap during burping sessions. They’re also versatile enough to be used as washcloths, which is a bonus.What truly sets these burp cloths apart is their durability.

The top part is also wonky with sizing and may not fit properly without tailoring.Also, with wearing for two days my ribs are sore from wear with how thin the boning is, it’s odd how I could flip the bottom half of my corset up to use the restroom as that’s impossible with more well made ones.Overall, the price is decent and I love the design of it so it’s a keeper for me personally.

I only bought it for a test run, but I think this will be added to my (small) skirt collection, and I’m tempted to get more colors. I have no cons for this skirt. My biggest pro is that the waistband looks nice - I’m picky about them, and this one looks “finished” to where I wouldn’t mind it being visible if I tucked a shirt into it.For context, I am 5’5” and usually get pants size 28 - for this skirt, I got a small and have a tiny bit of room (perfect for a sweater tuck and/or tights) for something that’s stretchy.","Comfy, stretchy, high quality, and cute!!",2023-09-11,5.0,R2W4BB11WAECZ1,Vince,0.0,"Color #17 is dark blue and red just so you know.

Although SCARF is not as tightly woven as the gloves and cap, when draped properly around the neck, it is very cozy. Considering  that this  three piece set is made from acrylic fabric, it comes as no surprise that the beanie, gloves and scarf are durable, easy to wear and most importantly they appear to have a low level of water absorption.  •(It is yet to be determined how well this product stays dry during episodes of rain, snow or sleet  (Winter wearing updates to be provided) •Thus far, I am delighted that this product provides an exceptional level of wearability.

I mean that literally, not metaphorically. For the past 15 years I've had pretty formidable alopecia, and at this point, no matter what I do, it's impossible to have a good hair day. No amount of washing, styling, cutting, barrettes, scrunchies or styling products is going to turn twelve limp strands into huge, voluminous sexy hair. Ach, life!  Because of that, I rely on hats to both hide the follicle exodus and create some alternative visual interest up in the head area...but there are more problems, in that I'm a large gal with a strangely-shaped body and face like a lump of bread dough, and most hats either don't fit or look horrible on me. It's really hard to find a hat with the exact right proportions to be flattering. I've been rotating the same 4 hats constantly for years now, but none of them are summer hats -- they're all dark, wintery materials -- and so, this month, I went on an Amazon Hat Quest, ordered five that I thought might work for summer or multiple seasons, and tested them out.This hat, people. This is the hat I was meant to find. I am in LOVE.This porkpie hat is like a fresh breeze blowing in from a small-town lake where little duck families paddle and quack, and a wee boy runs through the grass, trying to get his very first kite up into the air, and somewhere in the distance, a barbershop quartet is sweetly singing.  It's light and breathable, yet still quite sturdy -- I've packed it in a carry bag and it retains its shape -- and it really does exude a sense of summer whimsy. The proportions are perfect -- I tried a couple other boater/porkpie/skimmer straw hats, and either the brims didn't stick out far enough to read as that style, or the crowns were too short and didn't hug my head at all. This hat has room to be pushed down on one's head so that it stays put, and has enough brim to create some shade. It comes with a little baggie of several different feathers to decorate the attached ribbon (what a cute touch!), but it also works great with a colorful scarf tied around it, which is what I tend to do for fun. But the best part of this hat is the cleverness of the secret feature. Shhhhh, lean in close!! Are you ready?On the inside of the hat there's a fabric sweat band -- which is a great feature on its own -- but tucked under the sweat band is a thin strip of velcro that attaches to its velcro mate, sewn in place on the hat. That thin strip can be relocated along the in-place velcro to make the fit of the hat tighter or looser -- basically like pulling in the inside circumference of the hat a little bit -- and it really works! It's so flipping clever, and you'd never know it was there if you didn't know it was there! Whoever designed that feature deserves a raise, and at least one free hat.I'm probably going to have to get at least one more of this hat in another color, I love it so much. You should get one too!",One of the best Amazon purchases I've ever made!,2023-05-22,5.0,R2CP7ERIDFN97,Milton Travis,0.0,The hat made my ample head look even larger and I lost one feather arrangement immediately!

I can recommend them for many different uses, such as:*Gentle washcloth for sensitive skin, face, etc.*Under-eye makeup remover*Idea: This wonderfully SOFT cotton could be sewn as gentle absorbent pad for light urinary incontinence (maybe add wings and a small snap underneath). Store-bought pads can dry out and irritate a woman’s delicate skin, according to dermatologist.

I did take my measurements into account with the picture when ordering and it still was technically too small. I had to take the laces from a more expensive corset with longer laces to get the corset on with the zipper since there is no protective panel to save your skin, when I could then get it pretty tight to fit the way I like my corset to. The top part is also wonky with sizing and may not fit properly without tailoring.Also, with wearing for two days my ribs are sore from wear with how thin the boning is, it’s odd how I could flip the bottom half of my corset up to use the restroom as that’s impossible with more well made ones.Overall, the price is decent and I love the design of it so it’s a keeper for me personally.

I mean that literally, not metaphorically. For the past 15 years I've had pretty formidable alopecia, and at this point, no matter what I do, it's impossible to have a good hair day. No amount of washing, styling, cutting, barrettes, scrunchies or styling products is going to turn twelve limp strands into huge, voluminous sexy hair. Ach, life!  Because of that, I rely on hats to both hide the follicle exodus and create some alternative visual interest up in the head area...but there are more problems, in that I'm a large gal with a strangely-shaped body and face like a lump of bread dough, and most hats either don't fit or look horrible on me. It's really hard to find a hat with the exact right proportions to be flattering. I've been rotating the same 4 hats constantly for years now, but none of them are summer hats -- they're all dark, wintery materials -- and so, this month, I went on an Amazon Hat Quest, ordered five that I thought might work for summer or multiple seasons, and tested them out.This hat, people. This is the hat I was meant to find. I am in LOVE.This porkpie hat is like a fresh breeze blowing in from a small-town lake where little duck families paddle and quack, and a wee boy runs through the grass, trying to get his very first kite up into the air, and somewhere in the distance, a barbershop quartet is sweetly singing.  It's light and breathable, yet still quite sturdy -- I've packed it in a carry bag and it retains its shape -- and it really does exude a sense of summer whimsy. The proportions are perfect -- I tried a couple other boater/porkpie/skimmer straw hats, and either the brims didn't stick out far enough to read as that style, or the crowns were too short and didn't hug my head at all. This hat has room to be pushed down on one's head so that it stays put, and has enough brim to create some shade. It comes with a little baggie of several different feathers to decorate the attached ribbon (what a cute touch!), but it also works great with a colorful scarf tied around it, which is what I tend to do for fun. But the best part of this hat is the cleverness of the secret feature. Shhhhh, lean in close!! Are you ready?On the inside of the hat there's a fabric sweat band -- which is a great feature on its own -- but tucked under the sweat band is a thin strip of velcro that attaches to its velcro mate, sewn in place on the hat. That thin strip can be relocated along the in-place velcro to make the fit of the hat tighter or looser -- basically like pulling in the inside circumference of the hat a little bit -- and it really works! It's so flipping clever, and you'd never know it was there if you didn't know it was there! Whoever designed that feature deserves a raise, and at least one free hat.I'm probably going to have to get at least one more of this hat in another color, I love it so much.

I did take my measurements into account with the picture when ordering and it still was technically too small. I had to take the laces from a more expensive corset with longer laces to get the corset on with the zipper since there is no protective panel to save your skin, when I could then get it pretty tight to fit the way I like my corset to. The top part is also wonky with sizing and may not fit properly without tailoring.Also, with wearing for two days my ribs are sore from wear with how thin the boning is, it’s odd how I could flip the bottom half of my corset up to use the restroom as that’s impossible with more well made ones.Overall, the price is decent and I love the design of it so it’s a keeper for me personally.

It fits me perfectly and I didn't need to adjust too much. As for the top accent at the shoulders and neck, it's a size too large. I'd have to add new holes in place to strap it tighter, but then the back of the fabric is too lose and there's a big gap between the fabric and my back.However, if I go down a size, the bodice would be way too small for me to fit into.

I can feel that the lid on my 14” M2 MacBook Pro is not closing as crisp as it would without the GhostBlanket installed thus applying a constant pressure on the screen that really should not be there when closed. If the GhostBlanket was thinner (0.25mm rather than 0.4mm) it probably would have worked.Something extremely thin like a sheet of tissue lens cleaning paper would probably be a safer barrier than the .4mm thick GhostBlanket.On the positive side I can say that the GhostBlanket is an excellent wipe-cloth. There are two in a pack and they are well made. Still a high quality 5 star item even if they seem a bit too thick to be safely used for their advertised purpose.,"Quality Product, but beware...",2023-08-30,5.0,R8H0QK9OM1CT4,Richard S,4.0,"I got this mostly to protect the screen from rubbing on the keyboard. Other cloths in the past have kept the lid from closing completely, however this cloth is thin enough that it doesn't cause that issue (on an M2 Macbook Air). I also have the larger cloth for a 17"" gaming Razer laptop and the material, color and edge finish is consistent.To make it clear about the product, you get 2 cloths in the package. The only potential downside is the cloth is a very light color and will probably stain if you have oily hands. Maybe that's why there are 2?In any case, very happy so far and the piece of mind that the screen won't get the scratches from the keys is worth the relatively small cost of these.Update Aug 2023: Something has changed. The original cloths I purchased were soft, I ordered again to have some more since they are handsnfor glasses and other screens and the new onesnare a lot stiffer and very prone to static. It's hard to tell if this new one will be as effective but it doesn't feel as good, which is disconcerting",Thin cloth to protect your keyboard that doesn't interfere with closing the laptop screen,2023-01-20,3.0

I don't know why...So if the 2 new shirts come, hopefully they're a gd fit & feel soft, because I need a casual, CORRECT, bright white, button down shirt.**Oh! Btw, If u want a real WHITE shirt, well I tried this brand's white shirt, & it's like a little beige & off white!!

These are very INcorrect photos they have of their white shirt.Ok, but besides scratchiness, I like this dark blue color.I tried the black shirt & liked it, BUT BLACK SHIRT HAS WHITE buttons, not quite as nice looking w/out black buttons, haha.Other than these few things, if u don't mind scratchiness, then you'll probably like these pretty shirts.
